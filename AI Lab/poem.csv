“I’m interested in feminist oratory,” we think
Jess should say
“Specifically that.”
 
Yellow-breasted engine sounds on the
Joshua tree
Joshua tree mid-shimmy
 
I think every bird is mad
at me. Does that make me
an alcoholic?
 
Let’s take a break, after
the great San Bernardino sculpture party
 
sparkling toilet pieces lay tiled into
the pavilion,
silver flushers too.
 
TV piles. I am
uneasy. So what?
No match for the always sand and always
 
Air. I find a pair of leather pants
Hanging in a hut & touch them.
Definitely not leather.
 
I can see the sunscreen on your face
not rubbed in,
rivulets wet
 
the under-chin. Let’s get this next pitch
right, guys,
decades left of percolation.

I find the heavens beautiful,
I find the earth so too,
the seas and the ground,
the furling of water and gas,
the bright distant points
of our isolation. I take comfort
in the swinging pendant traffic lights,
the slurry of wet raw flour.
I am programmed to this language,
and can only voice my rejection of it
in the same language.
This is the power of diaspora,
the difficulty in finding alternative.
Let us send messages to the half-existent.
To excuse oneself, to claim not knowing
the future, is inhuman. I am so worthless
that my body serves as brick,
conscripted to build up my prison
until it is time to lay my own body
down for the walls. It is mechanical,
snipping into the loop of every lace,
separating from every link
the cold wrapped bud. At first the skin
is thick and bright,
then darkly collapses.
Nothing keeps its shape,
nothing stands itself upright,
we keep sliding apart into smaller
and smaller components, and it is
in the air above us now,
we do not mingle with the outcome
of ideas any longer, the energy
that knows whether cruelty
is disinterested or rightful.
They are so happy
while we laugh at them,
their eyes enthused and shining
while we trick them
into hurting themselves.

It tastes like all my night
when I'm at the bottom of the borough
sheets burn around me
through the night
Consecrate me
Consecrate me
Conserve me lover
In the sills of your love
in the cells of your palms
from the womb to cell
break me from the belly of ship
let me crash upon you
Consecrate me my lover in your rectum
in a rehabilitation center where athletes seek the best care
I break into you
Consecrate me I want to love you in Syracuse woods
in Sonnino love me against lamb’s wool
I am my sister's wife keeper
Consecrate me

You’re leaving Las Vegas, except
In German. Point. Point. Point.
Gave it out, beautiful gentilhommeComme vous êtes, toujours,
Unforgettable, circa 2008 how
You made me cum like that -
She got so mad in the bed - the
Hotel bathroom floor,
The bathtub, the apartment where
I was the crying queen
 
Those o’s still unforgettable
And now Paris. I cried today OW!
Your Antarctica cold last
Night. You told me they fucked
You up / I told you he broke
My heart and OW! Freeze
Dried my bandaid right off.
And then the glasses shopping
Memories today yada yada
Wasn’t about the cum shot
Where or if, was about the
Islands and how you said
in the langue d’enemie
No less: “DON’T TOUCH”
 
Don’t Touch!? We just …
They fucked you up all right.
You give so clearly but have iced
Out all the incoming gifts. WELL
PING my darling Walden island.
I can’t take that kind of cold.I’m leaving Las Vegas.
Just a moon in Taurus trying
To sing the sweet and
It’s not a great user experience
 
But I just want you to know
How unforgettable you are
 
 
When the candles call to Hera
I hope they melt your
I hope a goddess or many
Wash that loneliness away
And when I see you again (in 15 years)
There’s only joy and more
 
I prefer you laughing to tears
The good way. Drink us when
We’re done. Well, I guess I did
Almost kill you with a
Razor shave once so it
Seems silly to say I’m sorry I
Lost the phantom thread.
Maybe everything’s a ridiculous
never-ending non-planet
Tho, u did kiss me like unicorns
Exist and bond our skin
Like the organ it deserves to be
Known as
 
 
To know how unforgettable
you are because there
lies the bridge to the
Mainland. & baby, you
Deserve it all.

If you want to know the truth today’s my birthday
and though I often feel older, and sometimes appear younger
I’m 31, and like everything else that too can be fun
or a bummer, a drain on the cosmic energy, depending on what?
If you know the answer you win the future;
if you don’t the future is ours to lose or—
whatever happened to the old way of construction?
Well, one line still follows another, and my voices moves
between each space, and when I think of you I sweat,
or maybe just imagine myself like a cartoon troublemaker
big beads of perspiration jumping out from my skin as I
cringe behind the fence that the bully is about to
throw a bomb over, or drop an anvil over, or just put his
meaty fist through and right on into my scared shitless grin,
the analogy resting on our mutual vulnerability—
that’s poetry isn’t it?

And now it’s time to go back to THE HISTORY OF ROCK’N’ROLL
which means it’s my night to cook dinner for “the house”—
collective—and it’s gonna be smoked sausage cooked in peppers
and mushrooms and carrots, maybe some onions, and beans
for protein, or something nutritional. I picked the sausage
because it seemed to be looking at me in the Safeway,
not exactly the way I was looking at one of the cashiers,
a young man with curly blonde hair and nice build
who seemed to have a down home kind of friendliness,
or the woman with the little girl the same sizes as Miles,
who is a little smaller than Caitlin, both of whom were
pulling on my pants leg for pennies for gumballs as I watched
the curve of the woman’s arm as she placed each
well thought over item on the counter behind my
vibrational buying and didn’t even notice how much I fell in love
with her arm and felt guilty for objectifying a part of her
although she might all be like her arm and then I might
fall in love with all of her, but that would cause problems,
she probably is already in love with at least one person, and
I’m already in love with about fourteen on a regular basis, and
that keeps causing all kinds of problems because people who are
attracted to my style don’t like my ways—that sounded like
a pretentious folk singing prodigy’s idea of an early Dylan line,
but what I meant would never be explained right in a poem like this,
or one like Anne Waldman’s either though I like to read hers
because they make me want to write, and in my world that’s what
“great” writers are supposed to do–make everyone else, or
at least me, feel like I can write too, and then make me feel,
like I will, and then I do.
                                                                                  *
 
After dinner we’ll eat the cake Atticus made for my birthday
there’ll be some presents from some of the people in the house, and
maybe Annie will stop over, or Matthew might call from work, or we
might all go down to watch him make salads at
                                               FOOD FOR THOUGHT,
and maybe eat some too, all along getting stoned on the house doobie,
which goes too fast these days but never fast enough, which is
about the way I feel on my birthday about my life, either that or
the way I’m easily satisfied but never feel I can get too much–
sometimes everything is enough, you know?

There’s coffee and pie
with a widow from church.
Why do you sit
in the back pew? she asks.
I’m close enough, I say.
Can I sit back there with you?
I’ve always sat there, I tell her,
with my same two friends,
and their clicking oxygen pumps.
One sat next to me for years,
called herself my church girlfriend,
who metastasized, telling me she was
tired of waiting to die.
Now, there’s just my 88-year-old friend,
his pump echoing in the sanctuary,
and there’s that empty
space between us.
I’d like to invite the widow to sit there,
but I miss my dead friend’s laugh,
her loving stories about her husband,
and how we were always
glad to see one another.
I tell the widow all this.
What if I just sat there? she asks.
It’s a free country, I tell her,
and she smiles.

In the pink light,
haloes of cloud form over the mountains;
lightning, two valleys away,
then, not an hour later,
 
the explosion of thunder.
The roadrunners
pecking for breadcrumbs on the porch
have long since fled into the rabbitbrush,
 
into the endless ocean of grass.
Driving in every direction
down licks of red road, I have lost
myself in a militarized topography;
 
everything named after army units,
generals, scouts, miners…The Dragoon Mountains,Cochise Stronghold; defunct
 Gleeson and Pearce,
weird, rusty ghost towns, the only
non-derelict structure
for miles, the local school,
 
its polished windows and well-kept lawn,
a source of great local pride.
No mountain monograms
for these desiccated whistle-stops,
 
no giant Q or C or W in bright
white paint to mark
the township's still functional
sorta functional breathing, no
 
carving for them
into the planet's bark;
and thus they are blesséd
to me like no other;
 
every successful city
is a flimsy affair with civility,
its eternalness, like Paris or Rome,
mere hypocrisy.
 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,
BUY REAL ESTATE! Hail follows rain.

once billed as the safest
 
spot to survive
the inevitable nuclear winter,
actually topped Soviet Russia's
list of high-priority targets… Enter
 
the Orange Duck Candidate.
A haboob sweeps across
the Valley of the Senile.
In a week, the mountains
 
have switched from brown
to purple to green.
The desert is human
endeavour's most fitting graveyard;
 
the slow bleaching,
the gradual eroding into sand,
the heat stifling sound as it leaps into the air.
IT CAN'T HAPPEN HERE. But it always does.

We must have known,
Even as we reached
Down to touch them
Where we'd found them
 
Shut-eyed and trembling
Under a straw bale
In the haymow, that
She would move them
 
That night under cover
Of darkness, and that
By finding them
We were making certain
 
We wouldn't see them again
Until we saw them
Crouching under the pickup
Like sullen teens, having gone
 
As wild by then as they'd gone
Still in her mouth that night
She made a decision
Any mother might make
 
Upon guessing the intentions
Of the state: to go and to
Go now, taking everything
You love between your teeth.

In the next scene Walt Whitman
is walking around Boston
Common. He’s young.
It’s winter. Emerson
is there. They walk
and talk for hours, or really
Emerson talks. He scolds
Whitman for slavering
after tree knots and bobbing
with the swimmer. Whitman nods
but in his head he’s busy
tallying his orgasms.
At the carousel
an ancient Puritan is passing
his hat, singing, “Kill It Babe.”
Dozens of geese have gathered
on the frozen pond,
standing on one leg,
tucking the other like a dagger
into their feathery centers.
Well, Emerson asks the poet,
what do you have to say for yourself?
And Whitman, respectfully,
but sure now
all the way down in his bones
where the deep, frontier feeling
of disobedience lives, says,
essentially, go fuck yourself.
I’ll go my own way.

                ","
Give up sitting dutifully at your desk. Leave
your house or apartment. Go out into the world.
 
It's all right to carry a notebook but a cheap
one is best, with pages the color of weak tea
and on the front a kitten or a space ship.
 
Avoid any enclosed space where more than
three people are wearing turtlenecks. Beware
any snow-covered chalet with deer tracks
across the muffled tennis courts.
 
Not surprisingly, libraries are a good place to write.
And the perfect place in a library is near an aisle
where a child a year or two old is playing as his
mother browses the ranks of the dead.
 
Often he will pull books from the bottom shelf.
The title, the author's name, the brooding photo
on the flap mean nothing. Red book on black, gray
book on brown, he builds a tower. And the higher
it gets, the wider he grins.
 
You who asked for advice, listen: When the tower
falls, be like that child. Laugh so loud everybody
in the world frowns and says, ""Shhhh.""
 
Then start again.

In the grassy space between the wings of the elementary school and the trailers housing the fifth grade’s overflow classrooms, girls flip their hair in imitation of Cindy Crawford, sing Iko Iko. None of you know what it means or where the song comes from.
It’s honor-roll season, a time of outings to TCBY and Outback Steakhouse. Your mother warns you against filling up on bread, but it’s hard to resist the little brown loaves brought warm to the table with soft butter – a luxury that cannot be imagined at home, with its always-refrigerated margarine and Pepperidge Farm sandwich loaves.
Everyone knows what’s popular but nobody knows how to act. At ten, you lack any context. The world swims before you, and it constantly stings. Its favorite barb: “everybody knows that.”
Beyond the grassy space of girls is more grass, a quarter-mile loop of track, a church with a painfully white spire, a fence, and a neighborhood maybe a little less nice than yours, crammed between the school and busy Great Neck Road. The fence is of chain link, instead of wooden slats. That’s how you know about the niceness – that and the something hard, like a grain of sand, you feel in your mother’s voice, when she takes you to the school’s Spring Fling, where you win another goldfish. They always die, but you’re getting better. Now, it takes a while.Loblollies shiverIn May heat. The world’s ending.The world’s a mirage.

For Janna



The tiny journalist
will tell us what she sees.
 
Document the moves, the dust,
soldiers blocking the road.
 
Yes, she knows how to take a picture
with her phone. Holds it high
 
like a balloon. Yes, she would
prefer to dance and play,
 
would prefer the world
to be pink. It is her job to say
 
what she sees, what is happening.
From her vantage point everything
 
is huge—but don’t look down on her.
She’s bigger than you are.
 
If you stomp her garden
each leaf expands its view.
 
Don’t hide what you do.
She sees you at 2 a.m. adjusting your
 
impenetrable vest.
What could she have
 
that you want? Her treasures,
thing shiny buttons her grandmother loved.
 
Her cousin, her uncle.There might have been a shirt. . .
 
The tiny journalist notices
action on far away roads
 
farther even than the next village.
She takes counsel from bugs so
 
puffs of dust find her first.Could that be a friend? 
 They pretended not to see us.They came at night with weapons. 
 What was our crime? That we likedrespect as they do? That we have pride? 
 
She stares through a hole in the fence,
barricade of words and wire,
 
feels the rising fire
before anyone strikes a match.
 
She has a better idea.

for my granddaughter, Wahcawin



I didn’t want to scold the sky that year, but
 Grandma’s words taunted my senses. If there
is a thirst, then you need to pity the flowers
 
in a loud voice. Ask the frogs why they are
being punished, stomp on the ground and talk
to the dried clay about cracking open the earth.
 
I know challenging the storm is risky. “Last
but not least, burn cedar and pray the lightning
doesn’t strike your town.” That night, the stars
 
disappeared, so did the birds. Perhaps it was
the season for rain or the dance. In the western
distance, we thought we heard cannon blasts,
 
looking over we watched the horizon fill with
lightning strikes. Rain couldn’t pour hard enough
over the thirsty plain. Accompanying clouds,
 
called to thunder’s voice in extreme decimals
requesting all the water heaven could send forth,
to come. Rain and more rain filled empty stream
 
bottoms. Rivers who had pulled their dry banks
farther and farther from their center begged for
a drink to startle dusty beds with a flooding roar.
 
Lives in dormant places begin to stir and awaken.
 The lives of water beings, those that swim, the
ones that hop, and the ones that fly, begin to stir.
 
That year all thirst was quenched.

Tracks are all that define these voices,
hungry lives pulsing sacred ground.
We are a journey of distressed shapes,
red essence on parchment, occupying a life.
We look for the fated four-legged that paced
this way, a tested and well-worn path
among storms, mud, into this shared hidden
brush. Coyote, slipping by through old
winter grass, warns in a pagan tongue,
licking after our scent. We pick up pace,
tighten our careless reins, snap back at the
yellow-eyed clown with throat hunger,
that gnawing bone that drives us on. Quieted,
we hear the heart beating. A desperate breath
crashes through dry branches, a silhouette
give away. In an instant we let go
of weapons and invite a quick death. We
watch our knives glistening. Obsidian
works for us. What image of blood on flesh,
odor of iron. A vermilion sun heavy with
spring looks upon reflections of death
in hard visions, our favorable hunt—
whitetail not quick enough for downwind
lessons. Our horses burdened, deer shadows
left on landscape, we push forward.
These tracks ours now. Game will heal all.

This morning we found ourselves skinning a deer,
cutting meat, hanging some to dry and packaging
some for the freezer. It was the dogs late last night
 
that set off a howling, the unexpected smell of fresh
blood floating down the block, then a familiar car
horn honking in the driveway. My nephew and his
 
friends were hunting and brought us a deer. Mother
always said, “Cut up the meat right away, don’t let
it sit.” I look at a front quarter, a hole filled with
 
coagulated blood. Grandma says not to eat the part
next to the wound, “Cut it out; offer it to the earth for
healing, a sacrifice to remember the hungering spirits.”
 
Auntie says to save the muscle along the back strap,
“It makes good thread.” I carefully learned the exact
place to cut the joints so the bones separate easily.
 
Mother said that is important—“It means you are a
thoughtful person.” Auntie is at the door waiting for
a roast. “An elder takes the first piece,” she reminded.
 
Mom tells me to save the hooves for her. She wants
to make a bone game for the new grandchild, wants
him to be patient and skillful. I boil the hoofs with
 
sage, find the little toe-bones for her. My hands begin
to ache from the work, I soak them in warm water
and start again. I admire the placement of tendons
 
on the deer shoulders, no joints, just the crisscrossing
of muscle. Grandma says, “That’s why your dad called
them jumpers, they bounce off the strength of their
 
flexing muscles.” Late at night Mom helps me stake
out the hide. My back hurts; my feet feel like I’ve
been walking on rocks all day. I want to complain,
 
but Mom catches the look in my eyes. She says to me,
“When you get dressed for the dance this weekend,
you will proudly wear your beautiful beaded dress,
 
your beaded leggings and moccasins, and last, but not
least, you will put on your beaded belt, and attached
you will wear your sharp knife and quilled knife sheath
 
because of what you have done this day.”

The future is as sterile as a robot’s loincloth.
I drown my hands in sanitizer until they pucker.
 
Where this soapbox tree germinates, I collect
my germs and make a fountain of them.
 
Because yellow is yarrow and soot, and the future,
I’ve learned, is no suture. Because where I’m from,
these kisses are infections. Because dirt’s
 
ammunition against discipline, the blood fills
my clean mouth with dismay. Am I surprised—
Hollywood still assumes we are all the bastard
 
children of the same evil dictator? That phosgene
and mustard will rack our titanium Maoist husks
until some white man with slanty eyes rescues us
 
from our mealy, pliant selves? Am I to wear Dior,
wrap my mouth in bloody tulle, before kneeling,
bending to kiss a mouth dirtied by Pantone 136?
 
No fucking thanks. Because where I’m from,
these kisses are infractions. Darlings, let’s rewrite
the script. Let’s hijack the narrative, steer
 
the story ourselves. There’d be a heist, a battle.
Audre Lorde would write the script. My leading
man would be Bruce. We’d earn our happy ending.
 
Instead, they give me 1981. 2012. Quantum quasars,
new dystopia—plutonium wars. We’re not in Polanski’s
Chinatown anymore. Yet we still have the same bowl
 
haircuts. Bangs, big bang, a city of fetid promise, new
minor galaxy where we cannot touch. Instead our skin
is rust and metal. It gratifies the technophile in all of us.

In the autumn I moved to New York,
I recognized her face all over the subway
stations—pearls around her throat, she poses
for her immigration papers. In 1924, the only
Americans required to carry identity cards
were ethnically Chinese—the first photo IDs,
red targets on the head of every man, woman,
child, infant, movie star. Like pallbearers,
they lined up to get their pictures taken: full-face
view, direct camera gaze, no smiles, ears showing,
in silver gelatin. A rogue’s gallery of Chinese
exclusion. The subway poster doesn’t name
her—though it does mention her ethnicity,
and the name of the New-York Historical
Society exhibition: Exclusion/Inclusion.
Soon, when I felt alone in this city, her face
would peer at me from behind seats, turnstiles,
heads, and headphones, and I swear she wore
a smile only I could see. Sometimes my face
aligned with hers, and we would rush past
the bewildered lives before us—hers, gone
the year my mother was born, and mine,
a belt of ghosts trailing after my scent.
In the same aboveground train, in the same
city where slain umbrellas travel across
the Hudson River, we live and live.
I’ve left my landline so ghosts can’t dial me
at midnight with the hunger of hunters
anymore. I’m so hungry I gnaw at light.
It tunnels from the shadows, an exhausting
hope. I know this hunger tormented her too.
It haunted her through her years in L.A., Paris,
and New York, the parties she went to, people
she met—Paul Robeson, Zora Neale Hurston,
Langston Hughes, Gertrude Stein. It haunts
her expression still, on the 6 train, Grand
Central station, an echo chamber behind
her eyes. But dear universe: if I can recognize
her face under this tunnel of endless shadows
against the luminance of all that is extinct
and oncoming, then I am not a stranger here.

this morning I went to the doctor
and talked to him about this move
 
on New Year’s Eve I had trouble connecting
my thoughts on Sade and reason
 
we rang in the New Year
with Miriam Makeba’s Africa
 
I’d noticed that my inner life
had expanded, and that I was having trouble
 
thinking through it. The doctor said that Geodon
would loosen my thinking—I noticed
 
that I’d been moving through life for 10 years
in a Zyprexa mold. thought control, at its best,
 
like a sonnet. I do not feel invaded
by the television that I never see. Brenda made me
 
feel more loved than ever this morning, as my thoughts
expanded. Last night, in the slow cooker, I made
 
Lamb and Goat curry—amazingly good. I’d thought
to send Joel, and Peter, and Michael an email
 
letting them know of my transition, but did not. The consequences
of this transition could be catastrophic. I feel more loving toward Brenda
 
than ever. I could die, or worse. As I meditated today
my books to the left of me seemed packed and dense
 
against the wall. Soon, Chuck will be here
to play chess upstairs. I told the doctor this morning
 
that the philosophy and religion of the cyborg
have not yet been written. My
 
poetry
has just begun. I am
 
a Fourth Form,
though not as Dodie saw it. Together,
 
we can belong in this world. Artaud
arrived at the double
 
as I have. We share more in common
than I’d known before last night. I need less sleep
 
than before, and I sleep better
and am more rested. I feel sad and cheated
 
that I need to rely on drugs
so completely. I wonder about Paul Bowles’ stories.
 
I need to reach out
to others
 
through this. The doctor, this morning, said
that I was enlightened, but not
 
quite there—somehow—I can’t remember
how. I doubt he knows
 
what he means by “enlightenment.” I felt far away
from my sister yesterday, when she called. Michael
 
talked to me of Christ’s
tenderness. I feel tender in this moment. Over
 
and over I feel that words
do not represent me. I am not
 
sure what that implies of my intentions
in using them. Yesterday, Brenda and I saw
 
the Warhol show of the last ten years
of his life. There seemed to have been hope
 
to live meaningfully in capitalism then. ~~~~~~~ The waves
of this beginning, the new life of my mind
 
is settling. It’s been a while since I’ve written. I’ve decided
to mark my continuing with the seven tildes above. And I added
 
a title tonight, Muerto Vecino, after Zizek’s dubious interpretation
of Kierkegaard’s neighbor, and because of the funeral home
 
across the street. My thinking has changed, my being has changed,
I am more alert and more engaged in thinking through the world.
 
And I am able to speak better. I don’t know what this means
about who I am. I try not to feel let down that for so much of my life
 
I’ve been restrained by psychotropic drugs. Before Zyprexa it was even
worse, with up to 6 meds, as I’ve said over and over to friends. I feel
 
the need to make clear what my obstacles have been. Not for pity,
a little for pride, but also for hope. If I can do that, then maybe I can help
 
someone not suffer so much, like Brenda. I replaced the kitchen faucet
this past weekend. It makes me very happy that I was able to do it
 
successfully, without ever having been handy before in my life, and after
spending most of my life disdainful of being practical in that way. What a joy
 
to make Brenda so happy. I don’t know how much longer I will live,
and have often thought, recently, that it would be tragic if I died anytime
 
soon, but that it’s imperative that I accept death when it arrives, after
affirming life as fully as I can. It’s too easy, and stupid, to be simplistically
 
oppositional. And to not know that people can ruin anything, but
that the substantial things have value of themselves, is foolish. I don’t want to stop
 
at my own ignorance and lack of forbearance. I don’t believe in the West
on its own. As Michael says, the only thing that makes sense here
 
is love. I have everything I could possibly ever want or need for now. More books
will come, more music too. And love is immeasurable
 
when it’s real. I am so grateful to have more waking time
on the weekends. I plan on making breakfast for Brenda
 
every Saturday and Sunday that I can
from now on. Early. I see gardens in the future of our household.
 
And I wonder about a Great Spirit. What does the name matter? I see the stones that live
without water. I see the smoke that cleanses my vision, and a network of consciousness,
 
with each node another, on and on that way to the depths. My thinking will never
grasp it all
 
because of that recursively created network of interior life. My thinking stops
then, barely able to contain the spherical and vast darkness
 
from which all light arises. That’s why what I see is dark. It is brilliant
in its darkness. Like onyx and flint. I can only talk around what I’ve seen
 
the past couple of weeks. It reframes, completely, the rest of my creative
life and the rest of my days. All I aim to do now is to focus my attention,
 
so that I can see it all again in retrospect. So that I can read
and gather more tools for understanding it. So that I understand myself,
 
and something of the world, and love, and so that I help others. Geodon
will not erase it. I’ve seen it already, many times. It is my natural state.
 
I no longer see it as only hallucination. It is a way of being. A way that I can flesh
out, here. Slowly. Carefully. And as I do, its destructive powers,
 
which are massive and righteous, will subside. As it will know that it is being
given to the world. Because it belongs to all. And all will be there soon.
 
There are signs already. Because to see it is to break, unless one knows something
of love. It makes LSD
 
small. It is God and the Universe as One.
I am not the first to see it. But I am a person
 
given a chance
to write it, letter by letter, slowly, in terms of the light of my ignorance
 
to see more fully
what I do not know. I do not offer anything
 
but poems. But it breaks through
my mouth to arrive at the hearts of the world, at the hearts of the horses
 
of the world, to allow us all to speak in silence. It is not God or the Universe.
It is One as All in you. Because I cannot see through myself
 
without it. I see clearly
that the sun will not arrive
 
in this new weather. But that the moon
will take its place. I see clearly that the sun is there
 
to bring meaning to the sky, and that the earth is more full
with the light of the world
 
extinguished for a brilliant view of wilderness. This is a view
that extends through opposites
 
and arrives at a single body
to witness this song. And this song is not the answer
 
that you believe in, because one day
I will speak to you again
 
in the rain
and show you
 
that I do not know. Because knowledge
belongs to the earth. And the earth makes everything
 
I know. And now that there is less and less freedom
from coercion in a moneyed world, and now that Claire,
 
a friend, is moving on to be Christ in her own way, now
that Guénon continues to call me to understand
 
my ignorance, to depart again
from the friends at Kuna Yala, where I helped with the water,
 
with Brenda watching over me
from a hammock between palms, now that Panamá
 
calls again to give me a union
of the world, in more than two ways,
 
and to distinguish from the surface of these times, I
receive
 
a call to awaken in the snow. I receive a call to acknowledge
that Geodon has planted itself
 
with capital
in my consciousness, but that the world
 
is stronger than to balance itself
from the ozone and people alone. We are not erased, and we
 
do not control the earth. Geodon
is an act of kindness, an agreement
 
to live this life
in a way that arrives
 
with the weather. It may continue
for the rest of my life, or it may not. I will not be afraid again
 
to see things as I do, and I will not
seek out the truth, intentionally, without some kind of agreement
 
with this custom. Because that is a way, for now,
that I speak. And it is useful, though better left
 
invisible. And the name, Geodon, brings trouble, I can see
through it enough, with enough love in my life, to believe
 
in the end of the reign of the Anti-Christ (not Obama). I need to learn again
to be and to write. But to deliver
 
what I saw
I must return
 
to the explosion of my inner life. To start with, otherwise and generally, I see
only outlines. Creation manifests
 
from every direction, in an infinity
of dimensions. Most of us
 
spend most of our energy
conscious of a very few of these dimensions. Imagine
 
more than the greatest works of art
manifesting endlessly
 
from more directions than one can possibly count
every micro second, timelessly. It’s glorious.
 
And the only way to see it with any balance
is impeccably, ethically, compassionately, and with at least an aim
 
toward the Divine. It IS the Divine. God and the Universe
spoke to me. It is all, always, speaking to us. And what it says
 
is endless
it brings wholeness
 
to the precious moment. It goes away
when one tries to pin it down, as I do. I say less and less
 
as I try to describe it. It is endlessly
generative. It is good
 
but pitiless and merciful. It demands of us
that we arrive. And now that the thinking manifests
 
in a way that allows
for union and a bridge, in a way that avoids
 
easy condemnation, a thinking that reveals
the links toward light
 
in motion, a primordial
form of being
 
in a new world that needs no one
to believe in it, a vast chasm
 
in what a bureaucracy of thought
tries to pin us down with, the hole in time
 
that allows us to be free
is here, we know it. All of us
 
can see through delusion. There is no road
in the aftermath of earthquakes, no need for the time
 
to extinguish the elements, no person
locked to your heart
 
in the morning, no water to drink
without thirst, no air is necessary to breathe
 
under the water of seeing, no
need for the earth to do anything
 
other than revolve, in this
new light. Space
 
undoes our links
to the immovable. We deliver
 
the undone to the plains
and see what the harvest
 
will fill with seed. The whole
does not exist
 
within outlines. All we can do
is move to it. The music
 
is unheard of
in this world. It exists
 
without origin. It is otherworldly,
primordial, and gentle. It vibrates,
 
equally, in the Lamb, in
the Lotus, in
 
the stones—there is no place
unknown to it. It is
 
music, and nothing more,
and nothing less. It is that
 
everywhere possible. It is harmonious
infinitely, and allows for any sound. To some
 
it might seem like noise, but that
is only the part. To achieve it
 
one need only listen. I cannot always
hear it, but I have
 
heard it. And now
in my new mind, I listen for it
 
undaunted and silent. I feel it filling
my body with love. Sometimes
 
I have horrific thoughts. But I am learning
that these are but strong notes
 
in the fullness
of the music
 
of my new mind. I can’t always hear the song,
but I feel it now. It makes all context
 
vast. I will receive it
as long as it is here. I will not push
 
one way or the other with it. It is a fullness
and does not want to be made
 
into a force. It is a force
without me, and only to the degree
 
to which this is true. No longer being able
to receive it
 
will imply a failure
of my imagination, of my ethics,
 
and my spirit. There is no way
to hold on to it. It serves
 
no one. And it includes us all. To continue to receive it
more fully
 
I grow. This implies
the world. It implies clarity. It implies
 
motion. But it rests motionlessly. If I have a softness in my voice
it is caused by this music. When I don’t
 
I feel less. My voice can be loud
to receive it, but this loudness
 
cannot be yoked
in outlines. There is nothing I can do.
 
There is nothing to expect. I can only
let it go. And I can only be afraid
 
of the horror of my thoughts
without this music. But now that I know
 
a taste of it, I have
hope. Good people
 
feed it. I haven’t always known
what to do with it and others. But now
 
I am a little less confused
about this. This is due
 
to Buddhism, the little that I know
of its practice. And to love. But it does not stop
 
at my experience. I am ignorant
and cannot offer knowledge. Except this
 
music
does not require knowledge. I’m not sure
 
what it requires. It requires
to be received, but does not need us. Is there a pact
 
between humanity
and God? I don’t know. Is there a God?
 
I don’t know. I’m not sure the question
is enough on its own. Or maybe it is, if God
 
is not limited by concept. And concept
seems to be only a note in this song. Problems
 
feed it. “Love
is the absence of fear.” And “love
 
believes all things,
yet is never deceived.” I aim
 
to see through my delusions. I aim
to be one of many, a small voice
 
in the song of the world. I rest
in silence
 
as I always have. “To have a view
as vast as the sky
 
and as fine
as a grain of sand.” All beings
 
want to be loved
and to be free
 
from suffering. We strive
diligently
 
to learn the vast expanse
and the laser pointed focus
 
of this gift. Remember that light
makes us. And that in this
 
new world, more and more
is made of light. And if that is the case,
 
we move to move
the light of the world. Someday,
 
perhaps, we will move
the light
 
of the computer world. Only the compassionate
and true
 
will be able to do so. Because only they
can be selfless enough
 
to let it move through them. I am not there
to move it
 
but I saw this. Long ago. Briefly. I was offered
a glimpse. It is utterly simple and beyond
 
thought. There is hope. Intention
is a thought. So one
 
sees. I cannot tangle
myself
 
in the line. But only to bridge. That is part of why
it will all move. But I cannot wait
 
until that is possible
to become. I can wait
 
eternally and actively in the world
to remain
 
still. With the calm and expansive
link
 
that allows us to live, so preciously
together, I see through
 
the trouble that startles me, every moment
and allow the seeing
 
of my inner eye
to burn through it. I do not remember
 
what Zyprexa was like any longer. Except that it seems
I have more to work with now, with my mind. And these
 
words are plain, so as to be careful in this new place. I see
that they do not break open my heart, as I read. And for that
 
I relinquish this poem, and allow it to be only
a mark on the road to further inquiry. I allow it to see
 
as I have made a vow to bridge, that my life
aims to be whole, even in the face of potential
 
catastrophes, I grow more and more
to accept death as it arrives, to allow it to soften me,
 
and to transform me as I have been transformed through Geodon, only
to know that there is an isthmus, and that it is eternal. Only that there is one
 
heart to allow myself to speak
in the storms of tribulation, as one speaks
 
to allow the teamwork of the fabric of need
of the bird malingerer to see this
 
in the aftermath of one who has died. Like a bicycle never once
together enough to ride, I see this word here, again, to the removal
 
of a people, to the homeland of union and pace, to the isthmus
of a double link, one ocean to another, one continent
 
to another, to the only union (even as it may be erased in my history), the place
of one heart to allow the song to continue through conflict
 
as she saw it then, one time, far away, when I hadn’t known yet, that this
would be timeless. And there is one to it there to see it there, to allow
 
it there to become and to see there as one is there to see
and to allow one to arrive with it there and to see, and to be one with it
 
there as one is there to be with it. And to see there as one is there to believe
as it is one to believe it there
 
and to see it there as one with the soil and the air and the light and rain
and to be there with one to be there one with it there once again, and to see it there
 
and to believe as there is one there to believe it there again and to see. And to see
there as one is there to believe as it is there again
 
and to see there as one is there to arrive and to be with it
there and to see it there once again and to see it there again
 
and to believe as there is one to it again and to see and to hold
and to see it there and to hold
 
being that nothing holds

out of his teens, stands on the rooftop
of the embassy in Saigon, his birthplace.
He gives his hand to his mother,
and all around them, a thousand hands reach up
 
not to wave. None of his siblings died.
Their bodies like a fine chain balled tight
in a fist. They made it out alive.
Why is he looking at me like this?

This is the idea of a house my father built
in Southern California. These two circle windows
and bamboo on all sides. He brought a jungle here,
complete with French doors.
These are the tiles from his mother’s house, cool
against my cheek. I talk to him in one tongue,
he answers from the morgue.

Let’s get on with it.
When I return to that house, I eat the food
left out for my dead brother. I don’t waste much.
I slide open and close his closet, untangle
the window blinds. The bees are quiet in the
walls, now, their colonies dying off.
His shoes on my father’s feet are the only moving thing
in sight.

On their flight to America,
the choice for lunch was rice or pasta, but when
the meal cart reached them, there was only pasta.
My father smiled at the flight attendant and asked,
Why didn’t you reap enough rice?

Do I have permission to approach

He was looking for me and I was looking for you.

Gradually a girl’s innocence itself becomes her major crime
A doe and her two fawns bent low in the sumac along the bank of a highway,
     the pinched peach of their ears twitching in the heat
Into the disordered evening my brother cut out only his face from every
     photograph in the hall, carefully slipping each frame back into position
What good does it do?
Decades of no faces other than our own chipping faces
What good does it do, this resemblance to nothing we know of the dollhouse
New parents watch their newborn resting in a sunny patch of an empty
      room, the newborn making sense of its container—
And from the road a deer ripened in death and a tuft of fur—or dandelion—
     tumbled along, gently circled, driftwood, shaking loose, gathered,
     dissolving into the mouths of jewelweed nearby
Earth is rife with iron and blood is rich in stardust
Immediately I spotted one hoof print, then nothing, as if this was where she
      dragged herself out of the body
Strips of tire torn from their orbitIs it right then, that we are left to hurtle alone

J'aurais dans mes mains ton visage obscur
—Yves Bonnefoy



[1]
what should i call this poem i’ll call it a rush of chambers
a racket of foliage i’ll call it love poem with dark
face pretty title someone i don’t know who tells me watch
out for words with meaning don’t look for truth in beauty
learn to breathe with your gaze in an art gallery
a woman with sad eyes devours rats devours picassos
sleeps in hospital rooms listen to this story once upon
a time a princess bah death will not be long in coming
death with its blue eyes on my empty plate
 
[2]
she’ll never know who i am she’s blind and hates when people
look at her i offer her a bonfire a fistful of snow offer her
a freshly cut rose what should we talk about now? let’s talk
about the sky let’s talk about fear there’s going to be a storm tonight
a person would do better to drop and never get up how’s that i ask
but she disappears i don’t know if she’ll ever return still
i wait with my milk tooth with my old stamp
collection with my razor blade and a mirror at night
she comes whispers in my ear there’s no one but you
in a million years i’ll learn her real name know
her dark face flush with sky flush with fear
 
[3]
why am i writing this? you incandescent pupil i’m a swan
that dreams of dying in your dream inside a box where hell burns
where everything is blinding the storm doesn’t say a word stays mute
you should have seen me that time the vineyards were
in bloom the cows were grazing i was happy you were happy
the enigma’s transparence cooled our coffee the myth’s
dissection the death of any and all theories i’m a swan
my dream is to die in your dream why didn’t you look at me?
 
[4]
my students asked me what is the meaning of pain
so i sliced a doll’s finger with a razor blade there
was no blood no batting of lashes this i told them is pain
 
[5]
i read and write at the same time it’s only proper the mountains
overwhelmingly approve the night shuts one eye and looks at me
with the other there is nothing around but plastic flowers
purgatories on the brink of closure doors and windows the light
grows impatient time destroys clocks may i speak?
there’s no need to the pages are on fire your lamp is burning
i take off my clothes and let the cold ignite my penis
 
[6]
now i come to the hardest part of the story the part
where i talk about porpoises and dolphins the woman
with the sad eyes vomits rats into the toilet i speak of
my desire i don’t want her to know about it i’ll just say a word
brush my hand against her hair and if she runs ah the lost words
the dark rooms each with its death rattle of birds
all soaring skyward the woman closes her eyes
go in me she says i’ve forgotten your name i don’t have
a name from high above the bed a god observes us
his wounded body conveying how much she wants me
 
[7]
sorrowful boy come whenever you like i’ll burn in your memory sear
your tongue all kinds of confusion will find a place in your senses
any expression will be allegory in our hands i have a notebook
for you a glass of water some dead fish i said to her sorrowful girl
i love notebooks await every night a glass of water
on my tongue dead fish are a delirium my students
ask what’s delirium i unbutton my shirt and show them
your breasts this is delirium
 
[8]
a rush of overflowing chambers it’s playtime now you’re
the shadow and i’m the light you lick my wounds while i sink
into the lightning flash into both sets of darkness where you sleep
and i await the word smoke is the word tomorrow
your body and mine will sing and there will again be woods
unfurling before my eyes open venetian blinds a fount
of angels atop the dirty laundry tell me a story anything
what’s important is that we awaken and not give in to sleep
happy loves rot as surely as blighted ones do
bye bye she says bye bye flowers in her wounded hands
 
[9]
to let the body not love drift through other bodies
that’s how banishment how violent expulsion begins quite
a lovely light is dying amid the debris no one can see it
ice is deceptive when it shines bright the sky an irrevocable
past a voice inspiring pity a voice that never reaches us
 
[10]
disturbing the marble slab’s geometry beneath her feet
the sought-after metaphor is a blue cyclone the dark alley
the grave of all projects though nothing stands in our way
we can be happy but there’s no one here only me besides
the words the untimely trips and scarlet buses i remember
her light which made the pain grow dark and still she went away
i followed until i lost her trace no one ever taught me to lose a desire
a purple cloud envelopes my body the students ask me
what is a body i draw a word in the air the word bursts
and drops to the ground this i tell them is a body

                ","
[1]
i wonder where the title the smoke of distant fires comes from
i heard it in a park once at the back of my creeping devoted
ear the moon was red the forest as always abloom with
heliotropes and blue begonias yes i heard it in a park once
a dog was barking the moon was red the sun had already set
 
[2]
eyeing my steps she’d say good but with less emphasis
the words stank to high heaven the serpent was singing sweetly
careful she told me it’s a monstrosity a misshapen beast
years ago i placed a leaf from a linden tree on his back
which left only a scratch a mere flesh wound where time
records its march where the mangled falcon sleeps the blood
on kriemhild’s breasts recalling the blood on kriemhild’s
breasts her death at the hands of some hunter of wild
boars the serpent was dancing the moon was red the
hero didn’t seem to notice i have lost the pot of gold
he said i don’t know who could have stolen it from me
 
[3]
the trees let go of their branches allowing them to fall
it was spring and they couldn’t bear the weight of the snow
the sun shone darkly deer came down from the hills
rats fled the swamp and everything before me was allegory
yet i didn’t write a word
 
[4]
who is eyeing my steps? who is dictating me words?
who is telling me now is the time? i don’t know
 
who is eyeing my steps who is dictating me words who
is telling me now is the time
 
[5]
i’m with my parents in melbourne this has to be a dream
i’ve never been to melbourne my parents look at a plate of
food with no interest one way or the other i feel uncomfortable
at times that’s how i remember you i can never get past
your eyes i don’t have any eyes ask siegfried ask the serpent
ask him what’s become of your words of the papers you
tossed in the wastebasket of the much hoped-for rain in the linden
tree forest i’m talking about hell about charon’s coins
about the barking dog the one that won’t let us sleep
 
[6]
we’re not in melbourne and this is no dream truth
to tell i don’t know where we are i see a park nearby hear
some music the rustling of leaves we’re alone tonight
you’re like a tiger i love your fear the streak of light rending
your shadow the solar mantle where beauty burns forget
the flesh for a moment forget about beauty for now you’re
with me tonight why is the moon so red she asks
 
[7]
it isn’t night and we aren’t in park we’re in thebais
at either the beginning or the end of a storm it’s like a line
you know by heart memory can be so cruel preserving
a marble column a red desert and nothing else around them
but rocks spiders scorpions a pious crowd and a rabbit
why a pious crowd she asks why a rabbit i must have read
about them in a poem seen them in a medieval painting or some
movie short perhaps praying high in the air i grasped the serpent
and if a cloud brushed my ears i gave god thanks for it was his hand
he ordered me to read but no one had ever taught me how
 
[8]
you must be simeon then she said pointing out my sandals
my lack of social graces my eyes brimming over with desert
 
[9]
she listens to the rustling of the leaves to the whistling of the wind
tell me we’ve always been here tell me you never went away
read me the part about the hero’s betrayal the dream of the eagle
devouring the falcon tell me it’s nighttime our neighbors wave
at us with no interest one way or the other the birds pick apart
     their nests
on the riverbank a dog barks a dog that won’t let us sleep
 
[10]
water and mud common ground sketch their alphabet the metaphor
is burning i see it shrivel to nothing amid the rubble we don’t
need to write don’t need to read tonight the serpent
is very excited for it’s celebrating a birth as the words rot
and the moon shines a charon’s palm what should i do?
 
hold on to it she says write the smoke of distant fires

Wandering slowly back after dark one night
above a river, toward a suspension bridge,
a sound concerns him that might be a tune
or might not: noise drifting in, trailing off.
 
Then concerns him again, now clearly a song
pulsing out from the opposite bank, being sung
by chorusing men, all pewter-haired or bald,
in the function suite of a shabby hotel.
Above their heads a conductor’s hand
draws and casts the notes with a white wand.
 
Songs about mills and mines and a great war,
about mermaid brides and solid gold hills,
songs from broken hymnbooks and cheesy films.
 
Then his father’s voice rising out of that choir,
and his father’s father’s voice, and voices
of fathers before, concerning him only,
arcing through charged air and spanning the gorge.
He steps over the cliff edge and walks across.

Already been dead to you

Chapters of a democracy story
Descendants of genocide
Twelve score and more years ago
We went from being the majority
To being the smallest minority

We saw that emptying
Early morning skyline
Back through that horizon
Duck Valley 1979, Wounded Knee
Sand Creek, that Trail of Tears
Exactly how did our land
Become your country
Now you want us
To cry your tears for you
While we’re still crying tears of our own
 
With your past as your future
That industrial ruling class
Using religion as a weapon
Distilling love into hate
Pointing fingers and name calling evil
Sacrificing lives and blood
Making the innocent the new virgins
Offering to the gods of profit
Now you want us
To cry your tears for you
 
In the homeland security
Pretending corporate corruption
Isn’t economic terrorism
Money talks while the government listens
Compiling files on ones who think different
Conditioning an acceptance of debt
And not to expect the truth
So get used to hearing the lie
Now you want us
To cry your tears for you
 
Misusing the beauty
Turning freedom into a killing machine
Mass murdering the environment
Weaponizing the psychology of fear
And pushing material addiction with
A substitution of rules faking the law
The bill of rights becomes collateral damage
Making the constitution another broken treaty
Now you want us
To cry your tears for you
 
Way this story is unfolding
We may end up crying together
As in crying at the same time
But we’re short on tears to cry for you
With all these tears to cry of our own
Now you want us
To cry your tears for you

You wanna know what happened to Elvis
I’ll tell you what happened
I oughta know man I was one of his army
I mean man I was on his side
He made us feel all right
We were the first wave in the
Postwar baby boom
The generation before had just come
Out of the Great Depression and World War II
You know heavy vibes for people to wear
So much heaviness like some kind of
Voiding of the emotions
 
Their music you know the songs
Life always carries
You know every culture has songs
Well anyway their music was
Restrained emotion
You know like you didn’t wanna dance
If you didn’t know how
Which says something strange
Well anyway Elvis came along
About ten years after the nuke
When the only generals America had in
The only army she had were Ike and Mac
And stupor hung over the land
A plague where everyone tried to
Materially free themselves
Still too shell-shocked to understand
To feel what was happening
 
Everything was getting hopeless
Then when Elvis started to rock
The roll just picked up
I mean drabness the beaver showed us
Could only be a foretold future
Who wanted to be Ward and June and
I mean father never did know best
He was still crazy from surviving the war
 
Like there was this psychotic pall
So widespread as to be assumed normal
Heavy man     you know really
Anyway Elvis showed us an out
You know he showed everyboyman and
Everygirlwoman there’s something good
In feeling good
Like a prophet for everyboy everygirl
When someones mom and dad lied
Something about him told us
To be sensual is really okay
Someones mom and dad waltzed us around
Everygirl wasn’t supposed to enjoy it
If she did she was bad and everyboy
Well boys will be boys don’t feel anything
Take what you can
Marry a decent girl when the fun’s done
Like no matter what we did we all were guilty
Maybe someones mom and dad resented
What they missed and while
They were trying to pass it on us
We heard Elvis’s song and
For the first time we made up our own mind
 
The first wave rebelled
I mean we danced even if we didn’t know how
I mean Elvis made us move
Instead of standing mute he raised our voice
And when we heard ourselves               something
Was changing you know like for the first time
We made a collective decision about choices
 
America hurriedly made Pat Boone
A general in the army they wanted us to join
But most of us held fast to Elvis
And the commandants around him
Chuck Berry Buddy Holly Little Richard
Bo Diddley Gene Vincent     you know
Like a different civil war all over again
 
I mean you take don’t be cruel
I want you I need you I love you
And jailhouse rock
Or you take Pat and his white bucks
Singing love letters in the sand
Hell man what’s real here
I mean Pat at the beach in his white bucks
His ears getting sunburned told us
Something about old wave delusion
I mean wanting and needing and imprisonment
We all been to those places but what did
White bucks at the beach understand
Other than more straight line dancing
You know what I mean
 
Anyway man for a while we had a breather
Fresh energy to keep us from falling into the big sleep
Then before long Elvis got assassinated in all the fame
Taking a long time to die       others seized
Control while Elvis rode the needle out
Never understanding what he’d done
 
It’s like we were the baby boom because
Life needed a fresher start
I mean two world wars in a row is
Really crazy man
And Elvis even though he didn’t know he said it
He showed it to us anyway and even though
We didn’t know we heard it        we heard it anyway
 
Man like he woke us up
And now they’re trying to put us
Back to sleep so we’ll see how it goes
Anyway look at the record man
Rock ’n’ roll is based on revolution
Going way past 33 1/3
You gotta understand man he was
America’s baby boom Che
I oughta know man     I was in his army

Reading poetry from Central America
After talking with my brother
Suddenly remembering how they kill
Couldn’t really say it straight before
They told me you were dead
I died
They told me your mother was dead
I died again
They told me the kids were dead
I died with each name
 
Fire
The government said accident
They lied
Duck Valley my El Salvador
Our last kiss was our last good-bye
They came for you in winter’s night
Winter’s wind wailed in mourning
Government people searched for days
Scene of crime digging through ashes
Looking for body parts and disturbing evidence
We buried you all in a large grave
While a blizzard covered us in a blanket of snow
How it stormed terrible pain in the land of the free
 
Some ones should have noticed
Fewer women laughing
Some ones should have noticed
Fewer children growing up
But this isn’t El Salvador
 
Warm strong willed woman
I still have memories you gave me
Maybe if we recognized peasant eyes
Maybe if we recognized plantation lies
Archbishop Romero would have nothing
On you
Trying not to cry how will I ever stop
Ever see a wounded lion try hiding pain
Watch out it doesn’t work
But this isn’t El Salvador
 
At times I feel every embrace we shared
At times every tender moment still lives
Met Sandinista who touched my cheek
Kind of like you used to
Said to me you are one of us
But this isn’t El Salvador
 
Gentle woman natural mother natural world
Some people won’t comprehend what happens
Who wants realities cluttered by acts of war
Have to keep a lot inside at times
Not offending people with words
They don’t want to see pictures of
But this isn’t El Salvador
 
Some people told me I’m strong to survive
I’m not strong I’m not weak     no morality
No right no wrong one tear at a time I fall I rise
But this isn’t El Salvador
 
You loved your people
In the face of the American dream
Fry bread and tortillas some wars are the same
Who thinks Wounded Knee and Sand Creek
Happen only in history books      is this not history
We live we die                       but this isn’t El Salvador
 
The first look you gave me
Your eyes spoke your spirit your heart
My heart our heart there was no other way
Some ones say we’re with you brother
We understand what’s been done
Some ones say but this isn’t El Salvador
This is America                     yes I know
Almost two thousand seasons
We fall we rise       we fall we rise

still uncertain when I call

saying Hi, Dad, and from where,

still pausing in that powdered air,

still concentrating, trying to keep
us separate, our needs, do whatshe would, letting my mother sleep,

to choose between us, make some shift

it is tonight, which girl to lift,
to whisper or hum, which lullaby.

You whom I could not save,Listen to me.
 
Can we agree Kevlar
backpacks shouldn’t be needed
 
for children walking to school?
Those same children
 
also shouldn’t require a suit
of armor when standing
 
on their front lawns, or snipers
to watch their backs
 
as they eat at McDonalds.
They shouldn’t have to stop
 
to consider the speed
of a bullet or how it might
 
reshape their bodies. But
one winter, back in Detroit,
 
I had one student
who opened a door and died.
 
It was the front
door of his house, but
 
it could have been any door,
and the bullet could have written
 
any name. The shooter
was thirteen years old
 
and was aiming
at someone else. But
 
a bullet doesn’t care
about “aim,” it doesn’t
 
distinguish between
the innocent and the innocent,
 
and how was the bullet
supposed to know this
 
child would open the door
at the exact wrong moment
 
because his friend
was outside and screaming
 
for help. Did I say
I had “one” student who
 
opened a door and died?
That’s wrong.
 
There were many.
The classroom of grief
 
had far more seats
than the classroom for math
 
though every student
in the classroom for math
 
could count the names
of the dead.
 
A kid opens a door. The bullet
couldn’t possibly know,
 
nor could the gun, because
“guns don’t kill people,” they don’t
 
have minds to decide
such things, they don’t choose
 
or have a conscience,
and when a man doesn’t
 
have a conscience, we call him
a psychopath. This is how
 
we know what type of assault rifle
a man can be,
 
and how we discover
the hell that thrums inside
 
each of them. Today,
there’s another
 
shooting with dead
kids everywhere. It was a school,
 
a movie theater, a parking lot.
The world
 
is full of doors.
And you, whom I cannot save,
 
you may open a door
and enter
 
a meadow or a eulogy.
And if the latter, you will be
 
mourned, then buried
in rhetoric.
 
There will be
monuments of legislation,
 
little flowers made
from red tape.
 What should we do? we’ll ask
again. The earth will close
 
like a door above you.What should we do?
 
And that click you hear?
That’s just our voices,
 
the deadbolt of discourse
sliding into place.

Orphan in my first years, I early learnt
To make my heart suffice itself, and seek
Support and sympathy in its own depths.
 




Well, read my cheek, and watch my eye, —
    Too strictly school'd are they
One secret of my soul to show,
    One hidden thought betray.
 
I never knew the time my heart
    Look'd freely from my brow;
It once was check'd by timidness,
     'Tis taught by caution now.
 
I live among the cold, the false,
    And I must seem like them;
And such I am, for I am false
   As those I most condemn.
 
I teach my lip its sweetest smile,
    My tongue its softest tone;
I borrow others' likeness, till
    Almost I lose my own.
 
I pass through flattery's gilded sieve,
    Whatever I would say;
In social life, all, like the blind,
    Must learn to feel their way.
 
I check my thoughts like curbed steeds
    That struggle with the rein;
I bid my feelings sleep, like wrecks
    In the unfathom'd main.
 
I hear them speak of love, the deep.
    The true, and mock the name;
Mock at all high and early truth,
    And I too do the same.
 
I hear them tell some touching tale,
    I swallow down the tear;
I hear them name some generous deed,
    And I have learnt to sneer.
 
I hear the spiritual, the kind,
    The pure, but named in mirth;
Till all of good, ay, even hope,
    Seems exiled from our earth.
 
And one fear, withering ridicule,
    Is all that I can dread;
A sword hung by a single hair
    For ever o'er the head.
 
We bow to a most servile faith,
    In a most servile fear;
While none among us dares to say
    What none will choose to hear.
 
And if we dream of loftier thoughts,
    In weakness they are gone;
And indolence and vanity
    Rivet our fetters on.
 
Surely I was not born for this!
    I feel a loftier mood
Of generous impulse, high resolve,
    Steal o'er my solitude!
 
I gaze upon the thousand stars
    That fill the midnight sky;
And wish, so passionately wish,
    A light like theirs on high.
 
I have such eagerness of hope
    To benefit my kind;
And feel as if immortal power
    Were given to my mind.
 
I think on that eternal fame,
    The sun of earthly gloom.
Which makes the gloriousness of death,
    The future of the tomb —
 
That earthly future, the faint sign
    Of a more heavenly one;
— A step, a word, a voice, a look, —
    Alas! my dream is done!
 
And earth, and earth's debasing stain,
    Again is on my soul;
And I am but a nameless part
    Of a most worthless whole.
 
Why write I this? because my heart
    Towards the future springs,
That future where it loves to soar
    On more than eagle wings.
 
The present, it is but a speck
    In that eternal time,
In which my lost hopes find a home,
    My spirit knows its clime.
 
Oh! not myself, — for what am I? —
    The worthless and the weak,
Whose every thought of self should raise
    A blush to burn my cheek.
 
But song has touch’d my lips with fire.
    And made my heart a shrine;
For what, although alloy'd, debased,
    Is in itself divine.
 
I am myself but a vile link
    Amid life's weary chain;
But I have spoken hallow'd words,
    O do not say in vain!
 
My first, my last, my only wish,
    Say will my charmed chords
Wake to the morning light of fame,
    And breathe again my words?
 
Will the young maiden, when her tears
    Alone in moonlight shine —
Tears for the absent and the loved —
    Murmur some song of mine?
 
Will the pale youth by his dim lamp,
    Himself a dying flame,
From many an antique scroll beside,
    Choose that which bears my name?
 
Let music make less terrible
    The silence of the dead;
I care not, so my spirit last
    Long after life has fled.

Oh! yet one smile, tho' dark may lower 
Around thee clouds of woe and ill, 
Let me yet feel that I have power, 
Mid Fate's bleak storms, to soothe thee still. 
Tho' sadness be upon thy brow, 
Yet let it turn, dear love, to me, 
I cannot bear that thou should'st know 
Sorrow I do not share with thee. 
True love's wreath is of mountain flowers, 
They stand the storm and brave the blast, 
And blossom on, so love like ours 
Is sweetest when all else is past. 
Too well I know what storms have frowned, 
And now frown on life's troubled tide; 
Still darker let them gather round, 
They have no power on hearts so tried. 
Then say not that you may not bear, 
To shadow spirit light as mine; 
I shall not shrink, or fear to share 
The darkest fate if it be thine!
 
 Oh! say not love was never made 
For heart so light as mine; 
Must love then seek the cypress shade, 
Rear but a gloomy shrine. 
Oh! say not, that for me more meet 
The revelry of youth; 
Or that my wild heart cannot beat 
With deep devoted truth. 
Tho' mirth may many changes ring, 
'Tis but an outward show, 
Even upon the fond dove's wing 
Will varying colours glow. 
Light smiles upon my lip may gleam 
And sparkle o'er my brow, 
'Tis but the glisten of the stream 
That hides the gold below. 
'Tis love that gilds the mirthful hour, 
That lights the smile for me, 
Those smiles would instant lose their power, 
Did they not glance on thee!
 
 Oh! come to my slumber 
Sweet dreams of my love, 
I have hung the charmed wreath 
My soft pillow above. 
The roses are linked 
In a chain pure and white; 
And the rose-leaves are wet 
With the dew drops of night. 
The moon was on high 
As I gather'd each flower; 
The dew that then falls 
Has a magical power. 
The Spirit of slumber 
Those roses has blest; 
And sweet are the visions 
They'll bring to my rest. 
Be their spell on my soul, 
So they let me but see 
His dark eyes flash in love 
And his smile glance on me. 
Let sleep bring the image 
Of him far away; 
'Tis worth all the tears 
I shed for him by day. 
I have hung the charmed wreath 
My soft pillow above; 
Then come to my slumber, 
Sweet dreams of my love!
 
 
How vain to cast my love away 
On bosom false as thine; 
The floweret's bloom, that springs in May, 
Would be a safer shrine 
To build my fondest hopes upon, 
Tho' fragile it may be. 
That flower's smile is not sooner gone 
Than love that trusts to thee. 
Love asks a calm, a gentle home, 
Or else its life is o'er; 
If once you let its pinions roam, 
Oh! then 'tis love no more. 
The aspin's changefuI shade can be 
No shelter for the dove; 
And hearts as varying as that tree, 
Are sure no place for love. 
Hope linger'd long and anxiously, 
O'er failing faith, but now 
I give thee back each heartless sigh, 
Give back each broken vow. 
I'll trust the stay of tulip dyes, 
The calm of yon wild sea, 
The sunshine of the April skies, 
But never more to thee! 
 
 Oh! would that love had power to raise 
A little isle for us alone, 
With fairy flowers, and sunny rays, 
The blue sea wave its guardian zone. 
No other step should ever press 
This hidden Eden of the heart, 
And we would share its loveliness, 
From every other thing apart. 
The rose and violet should weep, 
Whene'er our leafy couch was laid, 
The lark should wake our morning sleep, 
The bulbul sing our serenade. 
And we would watch the starry hours, 
And call the moon to hear our vows, 
And we would cull the sweetest flowers, 
And twine fresh chaplets for our brows. 
 
 
I thought thus of the flowers, the moon, 
This fairy isle for you and me; 
And then I thought how very soon 
How very tired we should be.

Whether in land or in the funds,

He must be old whom I could love, 
Then he'll not plague me long; 
In sooth 'twill he a pleasant sight,
To see him borne along 
To where the croaking ravens lurk, 
And where the earth worms dwell: 
A widow's hood will suit my face,
And black becomes me well. 
And he must make a settlement, 
I'll have no man without; 
And when he writes his testament, 
He must not leave me out. 
Oh! such a man as this would suit 
Each wish I here express; 
If he should say, — Will you have me? 
I'll very soon say — Yes! ⁠

Was she of spirit race, or was she one
Of earth's least earthly daughters, one to whom
A gift of loveliness and soul is given,
Only to make them wretched?

There is an antique gem, on which her brow
Retains its graven beauty even now.
Her hair is braided, but one curl behind
Floats as enamour'd of the summer wind;
The rest is simple. Is she not too fair
Even to think of maiden's sweetest care?
The mouth and brow are contrasts. One so fraught
With pride, the melancholy pride of thought
Conscious of power, and yet forced to know
How little way such power as that can go;
Regretting, while too proud of the fine mind,
Which raises but to part it from its kind:
But the sweet mouth had nothing of all this;
It was a mouth the rose had lean'd to kiss
For her young sister, telling, now though mute,
How soft an echo it was to the lute.
The one spoke genius, in its high revealing;
The other smiled a woman's gentle feeling.
It was a lovely face: the Greek outline
Flowing, yet delicate and feminine;
The glorious lightning of the kindled eye,
Raised, as it communed with its native sky.
A lovely face the spirit's fitting shrine;
The one almost, the other quite divine.




My hand is on the lyre which never more
With its sweet commerce, like a bosom friend,
Will share the deeper thoughts which I could trust
Only to music and to solitude.
It is the very grove, the olive grove,
Where first I laid my laurel crown aside,
And bathed my fever'd brow in the cold stream;
As if that I could wash away the fire
Which from that moment kindled in my heart.
I well remember how I flung myself,
Like a young goddess, on a purple cloud
Of light and odour — the rich violets
Were so ethereal in bloom and breath:
And I — I felt immortal, for my brain
Was drunk and mad with its first draught of fame.
'Tis strange there was one only cypress tree,
And then, as now, I lay beneath its shade.
The night had seen me pace my lonely room,
Clasping the lyre I had no heart to wake,
Impatient for the day: yet its first dawn
Came cold as death; for every pulse sank down,
Until the very presence of my hope
Became to me a fear.    The sun rose up;
I stood alone 'mid thousands: but I felt
Mine inspiration; and, as the last sweep
Of my song died away amid the hills,
My heart reverb'rated the shout which bore
To the blue mountains and the distant heavenErinna's name, and on my bended knee,
Olympus, I received thy laurel crown.
 
   And twice new birth of violets have sprung,
Since they were first my pillow, since I sought
In the deep silence of the olive grove
The dreamy happiness which solitude
Brings to the soul o'erfill'd with its delight:
For I was like some young and sudden heir
Of a rich palace heap'd with gems and gold,
Whose pleasure doubles as he sums his wealth
And forms a thousand plans of festival;
Such were my myriad visions of delight.
The lute, which hitherto in Delphian shades
Had been my twilight's solitary joy,
Would henceforth be a sweet and breathing bond
Between me and my kind.    Orphan unloved,
I had been lonely from my childhood's hour,
Childhood whose very happiness is love:
But that was over now; my lyre would be
My own heart's true interpreter, and those
To whom my song was dear, would they not bless
The hand that waken'd it? I should be loved
For the so gentle sake of those soft chords
Which mingled others' feelings with mine own.
 
    Vow'd I that song to meek and gentle thoughts,
To tales that told of sorrow and of love,
To all our nature's finest touches, all
That wakens sympathy: and I should be
Alone no longer; every wind that bore,
And every lip that breathed one strain of mine,
Henceforth partake in all my joy and grief.
Oh! glorious is the gifted poet's lot,
And touching more than glorious: 'tis to be
Companion of the heart's least earthly hour;
The voice of love and sadness, calling forth
Tears from their silent fountain: 'tis to have
Share in all nature's loveliness; giving flowers
A life as sweet, more lasting than their own;
And catching from green wood and lofty pine
Language mysterious as musical;
Making the thoughts, which else had only been
Like colours on the morning's earliest hour,
Immortal, and worth immortality;
Yielding the hero that eternal name
For which he fought; making the patriot's deed
A stirring record for long after-time;
Cherishing tender thoughts, which else had pass'd
Away like tears; and saving the loved dead
From death's worst part — its deep forgetfulness.
 
From the first moment when a falling leaf,
Or opening bud, or streak of rose-touch'd sky,
Waken'd in me the flush and flow of song,
I gave my soul entire unto the gift
I deem'd mine own, direct from heaven; it was
The hope, the bliss, the energy of life;
I had no hope that dwelt not with my lyre,
No bliss whose being grew not from my lyre,
No energy undevoted to my lyre.
It was my other self that had a power;
Mine, but o'er which I had not a control.
At times it was not with me, and I felt
A wonder how it ever had been mine:
And then a word, a look of loveliness,
A tone of music, call'd it into life;
A song came gushing, like the natural tears,
To check whose current does not rest with us.
 
    Had I lived ever in the savage woods,
Or in some distant island, which the sea
With wind and wave guards in deep loneliness;
Had my eye never on the beauty dwelt
Of human face, and my ear never drank
The music of a human voice; I feel
My spirit would have pour'd itself in song,
Have learn'd a language from the rustling leaves,
The singing of the birds, and of the tide.
Perchance, then, happy had I never known
Another thought could be attach'd to song
Than of its own delight.    Oh! let me pause
Over this earlier period, when my heart
Mingled its being with its pleasures, fill'd
With rich enthusiasm, which once flung
Its purple colouring o'er all things of earth,
And without which our utmost power of thought
But sharpens arrows that will drink our blood.
Like woman's soothing influence o'er man
Enthusiasm is upon the mind;
Softening and beautifying that which is
Too harsh and sullen in itself.    How much
I loved the painter's glorious art, which forms
A world like, but more beautiful than, this;
Just catching nature in her happiest mood!
How drank I in fine poetry, which makes
The hearing passionate, fill'd with memories
Which steal from out the past like rays from clouds!
And then the sweet songs of my native vale,
Whose sweetness and whose softness call'd to mind
The perfume of the flowers, the purity
Of the blue sky; oh, how they stirr'd my soul! —
Amid the many golden gifts which heaven
Has left, like portions of its light, on earth
None hath such influence as music hath.
The painter's hues stand visible before us
In power and beauty; we can trace the thoughts
Which are the workings of the poet's mind:
But music is a mystery, and viewless
Even when present, and is less man's act,
And less within his order; for the hand
That can call forth the tones, yet cannot tell
Whither they go, or if they live or die,
When floated once beyond his feeble ear;
And then, as if it were an unreal thing,
The wind will sweep from the neglected strings
As rich a swell as ever minstrel drew.
 
    A poet's word, a painter's touch, will reach
The innermost recesses of the heart,
Making the pulses throb in unison
With joy or grief, which we can analyse;
There is the cause for pleasure and for pain:
But music moves us, and we know not why;
We feel the tears, but cannot trace their source.
Is it the language of some other state,
Born of its memory?    For what can wake
The soul's strong instinct of another world,
Like music?    Well with sadness doth it suit
To hear the melancholy sounds decay,
And think (for thoughts are life's great human links,
And mingle with our feelings) even so
Will the heart's wildest pulses sink to rest.
 
    How have I loved, when the red evening fill'd
Our temple with its glory, first, to gaze
On the strange contrast of the crimson air,
Lighted as if with passion, and flung back,
From silver vase and tripod rich with gems,
To the pale statues round, where human life
Was not, but beauty was, which seem'd to have
Apart existence from humanity:
Then, to go forth where the tall waving pines
Seem'd as behind them roll'd a golden sea
Immortal and eternal; and the boughs,
That darkly swept between me and its light,
Were fitting emblems of the worldly cares
That are the boundary between us and heaven;
Meanwhile, the wind, a wilful messenger
Lingering amid the flowers on his way,
At intervals swept past in melody,
The lutes and voices of the choral hymn
Contending with the rose-breath on his wing!
Perhaps it is these pleasures' chiefest charm,
They are so indefinable, so vague.
From earliest childhood all too well aware
Of the uncertain nature of our joys,
It is delicious to enjoy, yet know
No after-consequence will be to weep.
Pride misers with enjoyment, when we have
Delight in things that are but of the mind:
But half humility when we partake
Pleasures that are half wants, the spirit pines
And struggles in its fetters, and disdains
The low base clay to which it is allied.
But here our rapture raises us: we feel
What glorious power is given to man, and find
Our nature's nobleness and attributes,
Whose heaven is intellect; and we are proud
To think how we can love those things of earth
Which are least earthly; and the soul grows pure
In this high communing, and more divine.
 
    This time of dreaming happiness pass'd by,
Another spirit was within my heart;
I drank the maddening cup of praise, which grew
Henceforth the fountain of my life; I lived
Only in others' breath; a word, a look,
Were of all influence on my destiny:
If praise they spoke, 'twas sunlight to my soul;
Or censure, it was like the scorpion's sting.
 
And yet a darker lesson was to learn —
The hollowness of each: that praise, which is
But base exchange of flattery; that blame,
Given by cautious coldness, which still deems
'Tis safest to depress; that mockery,
Flinging shafts but to show its own keen aim;
That carelessness, whose very censure's chance;
And, worst of all, the earthly judgment pass'd
By minds whose native clay is unredeem'd
By aught of heaven, whose every thought falls foul
Plague-spot on beauty which they cannot feel,
Tainting all that it touches with itself.
O dream of fame, what hast thou been to me
But the destroyer of life's calm content!
I feel so more than ever, that thy sway
Is weaken'd over me. Once I could find
A deep and dangerous delight in thee;
But that is gone.    I am too much awake.
Light has burst o'er me, but not morning's light;
'Tis such light as will burst upon the tomb,
When all but judgment's over.    Can it be,
That these fine impulses, these lofty thoughts,
Burning with their own beauty, are but given
To make me the low slave of vanity,
Heartless and humbled?     O my own sweet power,
Surely thy songs are made for more than this!
What a worst waste of feeling and of life
Have been the imprints of my roll of time,
Too much, too long!    To what use have I turn'd
The golden gifts in which I pride myself?
They are profaned; with their pure ore I made
A temple resting only on the breath
Of heedless worshippers.    Alas! that ever
Praise should have been what it has been to me —
The opiate of my heart.    Yet I have dream'd
Of things which cannot be; the bright, the pure,
That all of which the heart may only dream;
And I have mused upon my gift of song,
And deeply felt its beauty, and disdain'd
The pettiness of praise to which at times
My soul has bow'd; and I have scorn'd myself
For that my cheek could burn, my pulses beat
At idle words.    And yet it is in vain
For the full heart to press back every throb
Wholly upon itself.    Ay, fair as are
The visions of a poet's solitude,
There must be something more for happiness;
They seek communion.    It had seem'd to me
A miser's selfishness, had I not sought
To share with others those impassion'd thoughts,
Like light, or hope, or love, in their effects.
When I have watch'd the stars write on the sky
In characters of light, have seen the moon
Come like veiled priestess from the east,
While, like a hymn, the wind swell'd on mine ear,
Telling soft tidings of eve's thousand flowers,
Has it not been the transport of my lute
To find its best delight in sympathy?
Alas! the idols which our hopes set up,
They are Chaldean ones, half gold, half clay;
We trust we are deceived, we hope, we fear,
Alike without foundation; day by day
Some new illusion is destroyed, and life
Gets cold and colder on towards its close.
Just like the years which make it, some are check'd
By sudden blights in spring; some are dried up
By fiery summers; others waste away
In calm monotony of quiet skies,
And peradventure these may be the best:
They know no hurricanes, no floods that sweep
As a God's vengeance were upon each wave;
But then they have no ruby fruits, no flowers
Shining in purple, and no lighted mines
Of gold and diamond.    Which is the best, —
Beauty and glory, in a southern clime,
Mingled with thunder, tempest; or the calm
Of skies that scarcely change, which, at the least,
If much of shine they have not, have no storms?
I know not: but I know fair earth or sky
Are self-consuming in their loveliness,
And the too radiant sun and fertile soil
In their luxuriance run themselves to waste,
And the green valley and the silver stream
Become a sandy desert.    O! the mind,
Too vivid in its lighted energies,
May read its fate in sunny Araby.
How lives its beauty in each Eastern tale,
Its growth of spices, and its groves of balm!
They are exhausted; and what is it now?
A wild and burning wilderness.    Alas!
For such similitude. Too much this is
The fate of this world's loveliest and best.
 
    Is there not a far people, who possess
Mysterious oracles of olden time,
Who say that this earth labours with a curse,
That it is fallen from its first estate,
And is now but the shade of what it was?
I do believe the tale.    I feel its truth
In my vain aspirations, in the dreams
That are revealings of another world,
More pure, more perfect than our weary one,
Where day is darkness to the starry soul.
 
    O heart of mine! my once sweet paradise
Of love and hope! how changed thou art to me!
I cannot count thy changes: thou hast lost
Interest in the once idols of thy being;
They have departed, even as if wings
Had borne away their morning; they have left
Weariness, turning pleasure into pain,
And too sure knowledge of their hollowness.
 
    And that too is gone from me; that which was
My solitude's delight!    I can no more
Make real existence of a shadowy world.
Time was, the poet's song, the ancient tale,
Were to me fountains of deep happiness,
For they grew visible in my lonely hours,
As things in which I had a deed and part;
Their actual presence had not been more true:
But these are bubbling sparkles, that are found
But at the spring's first source.    Ah! years may bring
The mind to its perfection, but no more
Will those young visions live in their own light;
Life's troubles stir life's waters all too much,
Passions chase fancies, and though still we dream,
The colouring is from reality.
 
    Farewell, my lyre! thou hast not been to me
All I once hoped.    What is the gift of mind,
But as a barrier to so much that makes
Our life endurable, — companionship,
Mingling affection, calm and gentle peace,
Till the vex'd spirit seals with discontent
A league of sorrow and of vanity,
Built on a future which will never be!
 
    And yet I would resign the praise that now
Makes my cheek crimson, and my pulses beat,
Could I but deem that when my hand is cold,
And my lip passionless, my songs would be
Number'd mid the young poet's first delights;
Read by the dark-eyed maiden in an hour
Of moonlight, till her cheek shone with its tears;
And murmur'd by the lover when his suit
Calls upon poetry to breathe of love.
I do not hope a sunshine burst of fame,
My lyre asks but a wreath of fragile flowers.
I have told passionate tales of breaking hearts,
Of young cheeks fading even before the rose;
My songs have been the mournful history
Of woman's tenderness and woman's tears;
I have touch'd but the spirit's gentlest chords, —
Surely the fittest for my maiden hand; —
And in their truth my immortality.
 
    Thou lovely and lone star, whose silver light,
Like music o'er the waters, steals along
The soften'd atmosphere; pale star, to thee
I dedicate the lyre, whose influence
I would have sink upon the heart like thine.
 
    In such an hour as this, the bosom turns
Back to its early feelings; man forgets
His stern ambition and his worldly cares,
And woman loathes the petty vanities
That mar her nature's beauty; like the dew,
Shedding its sweetness o'er the sleeping flowers
Till all their morning freshness is revived,
Kindly affections, sad but yet sweet thoughts,
Melt the cold eyes, long, long unused to weep.
O lute of mine, that I shall wake no more!
Such tearful music, linger on thy strings,
Consecrate unto sorrow and to love;
Thy truth, thy tenderness, be all thy fame!

Next thing I know, I am face to face with a bowl of Girl Soup and I just can’t bring myself. Some of us at the table are in a hurry to eat the soup, they are specifically trying to eat the  girls quickly because they seem to know that if you wait too long they turn into cyborgs or robots, and those are harder to chew. I can see that some of the girls are still alive and perhaps would like to be extracted from the soup, but when I squint I see that there are girls all over the floor with varying amounts of soup clinging to their clothes (you didn’t think they were naked, did you?) and so there goes that idea. Just at the moment I think I am running out of options, something comes over me and I take a deep breath and I do it, I jump right in there, that bowl of Girl Soup, no one is checking IDs or questioning my size or gender or race or voter affiliation, and I quick round up all the girls in the bowl into a large huddle. We have now obliterated two major problems: huddled together we are too large to eat, and also we’ve taken care of the problem of the eater.

Tonight at dusk we linger by the fence

or seems to decide, the tease is over,
and throws its petals backward like a sail
in wind, a suddenness about this as though
it screams, almost the way a newborn screams
at pain and want and cold, and I still hear
that cry in the shout across the garden
to say another flower is about to break.
I go to where my daughter stands, flowers
strung along the vine like Christmas lights,
one not yet lit. We praise the world by making
others see what we see. So now she points and feels

His shoulders globed like a full sail strung
Between the shafts and the furrow.
The horses strained at his clicking tongue.
An expert. He would set the wing
And fit the bright steel-pointed sock.
The sod rolled over without breaking.

Of reins, the sweating team turned round
And back into the land. His eye
Narrowed and angled at the ground,
Mapping the furrow exactly.

Fell sometimes on the polished sod;
Sometimes he rode me on his back
Dipping and rising to his plod.

To close one eye, stiffen my arm.

Likely the tool with which Louis Braille blinded himself as a child in France. An accident in his father’s saddle-making shop in the early years of the nineteenth century. Braille later invented a system of raised dots as a means of reading and writing for the blind. We don’t know much. Whether he was in the shop with his father or snuck in alone. Whether it was damp and rainy or whether the sun shone and brought to life the floating dust that always hung in the workshop air. Maybe it was just a little poke in the eye. A small tool, a small slip of the hand, a small injury. How a little fumble ends in blindness. It was decades before general anesthetic or antiseptics. Perhaps the doctor they rushed him to believed in the value of “laudable pus” in a wound. I don’t want to picture it. As a child, playing in his father’s saddle-making shop, did Louis Braille already know the names of the parts of a saddle—cantle, pommel, stirrup, tree? Did he know the smell and feel of each grade of leather? Of all the tools—punch and pincers, gouge and groover, chisel and awl—he chose awl.

Red blood cells live some hundred days before they are worn out by their silent hustle—looping and looping, pounded through the heart’s chambered cathedral, rushing out to the farthest reaches of the body with the good news of oxygen, squeezing single file along capillaries, like anxious deer probing their tracks through the woods. Rushing, silent, looping the circuits of the body. Again, again, again. Load iron. Dump iron. Load dump squeeze hustle.
Red blood cells pushed through the capillaries that pushed through my  retinas. They broke loose to run a green swarm in the corral of my eye. But that is history. Today cells still push through the capillaries fenced off by my calloused fingerprint. This one that I run over the Braille cell, the pattern of bumps.

I don’t know what the unit of measure is for how living in solitary changes a person. We know that living in a confined space, without access to the long view or landscape, changes the eye. The eye, for lack of practice, loses its ability to make out what lies in the distance. I don’t have a unit of measure for what this does to the heart.

A Braille cell is measured in spaces in a grid—two across by three down—that can be filled with a raised dot or bump. Different combinations of dots represent different letters, punctuation, symbols, shorthand.

The oldest cell I find in the dictionary is the monastic cell, a place for contemplation. From the concealed place where wine was stored. As in cellar. I find Braille contemplative. I touch my index finger to a bumpy piece of paper. My hand advances slowly left to right, the touch receptors in my finger triggered by the uneven contact of paper and skin. Messages run along nerves, finger-to-brain, brain-to-finger. Cognition sizzles. Mind notices this feels different than the pathway of sound in ear to auditory processing. Listening pulls me out into the world in an infinity of directions. Touching my reading educates me on my exact location in the world, feet in shoes, weight of foot on ground, weight of bones and flesh in chair.

Before you sink away
into the morphinesweet unreality of the everyday
we would like to say something
about those spasms and fasciculations of yours
as well as that bump on your back
For years you have no doubt been googling every freckle
Just recently
you were at the doctor’s with a patch of dry skin on your leg
Diagnosis: too much shower gel
But on hearing the word chondrosarcoma
you went home and immediately unplugged your router
Do you know where your priorities lie?
Do you know what life has to offer
or did those endless therapy sessions
and that eight-week mindfulness course
simply teach you how to tolerate suffering
that every signal in your body
can be temporarily expelled
to the rhythm of some breathing exercise?Let the pain beTo be free is to be free of need
Wrong
To be free is to need some fresh air
and to be able to get up and go outside

Yes, I am a body of rags lying
here on the bridge waiting for
a hot rain to wash me open,
dissolve me off the bridge
because this border is closed.
I rot on the boundary line
and can’t enter Juarez,
pennies thrown at me
when a drunk El Pasoan
returns in the darkness
and sees my shape that
makes him hurry across.
No head, decades ago they threw
it in the river without my screams.
My arms were the first to go
when I couldn’t climb the wall.
I can never leave this bridge.
I live on the pure line that divides
countries and grabs my hunger
from sliding into Mexico with
my outstretched hands.
I still have my knees.
I used to be sold in Juarez and
smuggled into El Paso, the egg
that floated down the Rio Grande
to break hundreds of miles away
before being thrown back.
I stay on the bridge and can’t move.
Do not cross to El Paso without wiping
your shoes of me, one foot on US
concrete, the other scraping away
at my Mexican rags.
When I struggle against the wire fence,
I make sure I salute two flags.

There can be no night without

lost between the darkness and

the buildings are torn and

Whatever kills them spares me

Shrines made of dung and branches,
With berries for eyes and burlap hung with holly.

Stood over the Brontës and clusters
Of black thistles’ script.

For twenty-one years.
Seven trees times three
Planted for the first children.
Oh its land was a meadow
And our little house, a grape arbor
And a Wampanoag
Grave in a grove of elms.
Then a tree like an elephant
Bucked in a storm.
And its trunk broke into
A wrinkled little stump.
Roots don’t give up.
And stones only breathe once a year.
Many people passed through.
We could have watered more
Or flowered a path
For the visitors. After all
Love meant life and its shadow.
Children played and grew.
I too grew old for no reason.
Love stood at a distance.
One day the snow will camouflage
The huddling April buds

Damns all but one, the littlest.

Fly from Sepiessa.

And tribal members
Now numbered

We almost sit together
But our feet of shadows
Show failed land deals.
Steps lowered and slimy
On a slip into the lagoon.
Ghoulish are the ghosts
Of time past: ancestors
With our same names.

Sunrise ocher marks
the river’s forehead,
wet dhotis betray supplicants
bare as opaque windows,
their secrets. It’s no secret,
my petals wreath
my crown in marigold, a glow
I’ve nursed into nova
when I cracked, from drought,
my pericarp, thirsty for God.
I have always been
a honey man,
coat of a langur, pilgrim-
body of fruit-
offering cast onto the tongue
of deity I prayed would move
in me. No sweetmeat
to sugar the idol
carved of me. The devout
fill brass kettles,
fill God with God,
to offer running water to Sun,
as mantras insist
from the temples;
the adhan’s pollen drifts—
yes, God is great.
Along the ghats
umbrellas bloom in red,
I breathe into nostrils of marble:The name of God is Truth—
vendors hawk neem branches
to scour mouths in bitter.

                ","
With “Waltzing Matilda,” funnel web spiders, and echidnas out of the way, you move on to the villanelle. The alien learns quickly, and soon the rhyme scheme and refrain are being applied to whatever it encounters: moonlight filling a green bucket by the door, a dog’s tooth in furniture, the sound of a nail gun. You go to bed and dream of planets disappearing like balls in a perfect snooker clearance. In the morning you find the walls papered with villanelles, each one signed by what appears to be a bar code. When you scan one with your phone, the screen lights up with footage of a satellite flyby through the heliosphere, trailing the sound of whale song, children crying, sustained applause, and Blind Willie Johnson’s “Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground.”

How do I compare the costs
Of leaving one system
Of cooperation
For another
System of cooperation?
How do I loosen the tongue
Enough to inhabit
The temple incognito?
What are the people to me
Until I condense my hesitations
And drink in stillness with
The rest of us, slightly drunk
But pacing moderately
Around the dew, dropped
To the knees at a tepid hour?
Cooperation is free, or is it
So? A refugee has no terms
Of comparison. Who really is
Aggrieved is a real fugitive
To freedom. The only enemies
Of freedom are border agents
And those dozing on one side
Of the other. The border condition
Realizes the personality.
That is why it has to be
Negotiated again in public
Houses. I tried to be loved
And everyone else failed me.
The dew is a corrosive.
It’s only obvious once
The horizon tempers
The topography again.
And this is so only when
Earthlight can be confined
By the foreground.
Allegorists are not agents
Now so much as internet vernaculars
We all get our chance to innovate.
Nations cannot be explained
Otherwise. Someone, we,
Made up the whole thing.
I want us to think we were
Liars then but are dying to
Finally grow up, no longer
Following fictions. But
Perfectly flush corroborating
Rehearsals.
The students can always
Have the data
They deserve.
What is oligarchy?
They call it up
And it clicks.
(Hear the disconsolate
fizz of epiphany
pitched out of library windows
and welfare field office exits.)
Everything can be
Said to have
Occurred. But do
They describe themselves
As belated or latent?
The reveal is just a mild
Turning in
Any case.
The air in winter
Is best for your device.
Cordon it around your
Device’s appetite.
Or there will be
A disaster
For the recollection,
Proof by perdurable
Association. (Check
the custom, or costume,
that to learn is
a bargain first fixed
in the recognition of ignorance
for which the learned refuse
to serve as models.)
Students delay excitement
Just long enough
And then they know.
You are a student
By profession.
If you insist
You deserve
A livelihood
You will be
Persecuted
For this
And that is
What has become
Of forensics.
That is the
Rootless fact.
Its reason is
Untraceable, so
Its stolid justice proffers
Souls for history’s
Paltry set of names
Of strangers. To
Assimilate novelty
Is then to obtain inventory.
What will you do
With it all?
Won’t you enjoy
The leverage it provides
So as to insist
On more?
It is not data
But esteem.
That is the remaining
Root system,
That nothing will
Have to be
Enough.

For Alexander Moysaenko



The black heart of the moon’s visible
through the trees from here.
Where are you?
I’m alone on the road
with a dead phone.
The birds are flapping overhead
but there’s not much light to be guided by.
If any horizon becomes visible enough to follow.
Forget the rain’s smear,
the chafe of fabric at the calf.
The money ran out. The diners are stuffed
and back for more.
Each terrible thing I said to the child
will get repeated hopefully as a joke.
And like language, these gestures, or a certain way of nodding
one’s head, it all eases in with less than a breath.
Forget the song’s words, the order of the band’s set tonight.
The black moon’s heart’s
got that sinister bent
and I want to get
touched at by the snakes.
One of the students in my class
used to go bear hunting with his two uncles.
They played recordings of distressed animals
to lure in tentative animals to kill.
This practice is illegal in many places.
Because it’s so very effective.
I split open the apple
and hand the good half to a child on the bus
nestled in under the arm of her sleeping mother.
Love from here is a long way to go.
Get on your bike and ride
through the lights.

It’s so flat here you can see everything. It’s not romantic. Nobody can slip in or out in secret, and who among us has pumped the last worry through her heart?
Collapsing into shade, I wish for more sons, endless daughters: a higher ratio of my people to other people. Why not want what I want; since we used all the air conditioning it’s become impossible to think things through.
Can you believe your ears? All the electric music in the world has been turned into handbells. I wish I had a cushion for my knees instead of gloves to keep the handbells pure. We can get used to anything. That doesn’t mean we should.
I went to a wedding where everything was outrageous but trying to act  modest by including very goofy elements, such as people in bear costumes and gold nuggets descending from the ceiling, only to be jerked back up out of reach when people tried to grab them.
Long ago, a matrimonial family collected a few eggs from each household in the village to contribute to the wedding cake. A pig for the dinner: a gift from a rich great-uncle. Shortly after, there was a period of department store gift services and electro-synth harps for hire.
But now we pick dandelions to make wine, and pluck chickens to make fine the groom’s cloak. He wants large brown wings; he wants wolf pelt for his loins. He wants he wants he wants. There is no end to that.
The bride is someone who has only ever served. No use asking someone who’s once had a true taste of freedom, whose eyes widened and whose pelvis thrust up unbidden. Better she be someone who might never know what she lost.
It is as it ever was. How many centuries have brides been made and used in this way?
How few centuries have let women be girls first, swirling as long as they wanted into their sweetness and sharpening to ripeness, only becoming women once full heavy love was their desire inside and out. Maybe one. Maybe not quite one full century.

It was like climbing a mountain to those of us who’d climbed one. To the others, it was like, I suppose, something else. In other words, we let  everybody find her own figure of speech.
Not that it—speech—lay thick on the ground, or mountain; it presented itself one word at a time, far between. A body had to keep an eye out, like for firewood at dusk, or else
miss her chance. Nobody else, let’s face it, cared about metaphor, or even simile, the like-it-or-not-ness of the mountain pretty much getting  between a body and her musing, in its going. One
step at a time, anyone could lose herself or someone else just staring at her feet. And if a body meet a body is not mere speech but something that could happen, like hopping a bus—though on the mountain
you’ll catch no rides, worse luck, the mountain requires to be climbed on foot, one after the other, nothing else will get you up it. There’s nothing like such obduracy but in the wild, nobody can tell you otherwise. No simple figure,
this struggle: just a crag, your burden, and your own two feet. Say  otherwise, talk through your hat, which I don’t care for.

1
The leaves sleeping beneath the wind:
A vessel for the wound.
Time perishing: the glory of the wound.
The trees rising among our lashes:
A lake for the wound.
The wound lies in bridges
When the grave lengthens,
When patience stretches
Between the banks of our love and death.
The wound, a gesture, is passing.
2
I give the voice of the wound
To the tongue of strangled bells,
To stone approaching from afar,
To aridity and the arid land,
To time borne on a stretcher of ice,
I kindle the fire of the wound.
When history burns in my garments,
When blue nails sprout in my book,
When I shout during the day,
Who are you? Who’s thrusting you
Into my notebooks,
Into my virgin earth?
In my notebooks, in my virgin earth,
I glimpse two eyes of dust
And hear someone say,
“I am the wound that grows
In your narrow history.”
3
I named you cloud,
Wound, dove of departure,
I named you quill and book.
And here I am, starting a dialogue
Between myself and the drowned tongue
On the isles of exodus,
On the archipelago of the ancient fall.
And here I am, teaching the dialogue
To the wind and palms—
Wound, dove of departure.
4
Had I a harbor, had I a vessel
In the land of dreams and mirrors,
Had I the remains
Of a city, had I a city
In the land of children and weeping,
I would forge them all for the wound
Into a spear-like song
That pierces trees and stones and sky,
A song as supple as water,
Unruly and dazed, like conquest.
5
World adorned with dreams and yearning,
Rain down on our deserts,
Rain down, but shake us, palms of the wound,
And break two branches off for us
From the trees that love the silence of the wound,
From the trees with arched lashes and hands
That keep vigil over the wound.
World adorned with dreams and yearning,
World falling in my brow,
Drawn like the wound,
Come no closer—the wound is closer than you.
Don’t tempt me—the wound is more beautiful,
And the wound has passed by that enchantment
Cast by your eyes
In the last kingdoms,
Passed without leaving a sail to tempt it astray,
Without leaving it an island.

I amuse myself with my country.
     I glimpse its future approaching on the eyelashes of an ostrich, I toy with its history and its days, I strike it with stones and thunderbolts. I extinguish its lamps and light its windows, and at the other end of day I inaugurate its history.
I am a stranger to all of you. I am from the other end. I live in a country of my own, inflating the sky to see its ashes, and in sleeping and waking I open a bud to live within.
Something must be born, so I bore caverns in my skin for lightning and build nests. I must pass like thunder into lips as sad as straw, between stone and autumn, between pore and epidermis, between thigh and thigh.
      And so I sing: “Form worthy of our demise—advance.”
     And so I shout and sing: “Who will give us the maternity of the cosmos, who will nourish us with mines?”
I advance toward my self, toward ruins. The silence of calamity takes me—I’m too short to gird the earth like a rope, I’m not sharp enough to pierce the face of history and plunge in.
You want me to be like you. You boil me in the cauldron of your prayers; you mix me with the broth of armies and the pepper of tyrants, then pitch me like a tent for the wali and hoist my skull like a flag.
     (My death,
     Nevertheless I run toward you, I rush rush rush to you.)
You live like flagstones, and lamentation is your air. You announce the hedgehog’s abode and sleep on the scarab’s censers—your children are immolations.
A distance as great as a mirage divides us.
I rouse hyenas in you, I rouse the gods. I sow sedition in you and suckle fever, then teach you to journey without a guide. I am a pole for your latitudes and a walking springtime. I am a convulsion in your throats, a hemorrhage in your words.
You advance like leprosy toward me, and I am the one bound to your dirt. Yet nothing unites us, everything divides us—so let me burn alone, let me pass through you like a spear of light.
     I cannot live with you, I cannot live without you. You are an undulation in my senses, and I cannot escape you. Even so, cry out, “The sea, the sea!” Even so, hang the beads of the sun on your thresholds.
Open my memory and study my face beneath its words, learn my alphabet. When you see foam weaving my flesh and stone flowing in my blood, you will see me.
      I am closed like a tree trunk, present and ungraspable like air. Thus I cannot surrender to you.
I was born in the sockets of lilacs, I grew in the orbits of lightning, I live with light and grass. I storm and I clear up, I shine and cloud over, I rain and snow—the hours are my language, and my country is day.The people are sleeping, but if they die they’ll awaken, or so it was said. You are all sleeping, but if you awaken you’ll die, or so it shall be said.
     You are dirt on my windowpanes, and I must remove you. I am the coming morning and the map that draws itself.
Nevertheless, there’s a fever in my bowels that keeps vigil over you.
     Nevertheless, I await you,
     In the shell of night by the sea, in the roaring of the depths, in the holes in the robe of the sky, in the jujubes and acacias, in the pines and cedars, in the hearts of the waves, in the salt,
      I await you.

Our city fled,
So I sought its paths in haste
And looked around—I saw only horizon,
And I perceived that those who flee tomorrow
And those who return tomorrow
Are a body I tear apart on my page.
I could see: the clouds were a throat,
The water formed walls of flame.
I saw a sticky yellow thread,
A thread of the history that clings to me.
A hand mulls over my life, ties my days together
Time and again, a hand that was heir
To the race of dolls and the progeny of rags.
I entered the rites of creation
In the waters’ womb and the trees’ virginity,
I saw trees seducing me,
I saw rooms among their branches,
Beds and windows resisting me,
I saw children and read them
My sand, I read them
Suras of clouds and verses of stone,
I saw them journeying with me,
I saw pools of tears and the corpse of rain
Gleaming behind them.
Our city fled—
What am I? A spike of grain
Weeping for a lark
That died beneath the snow and cold,
Died without revealing its messages,
Died without writing anyone.
I questioned it and saw its corpse
Discarded at the end of time,
And I cried out, “Silence of the ice, I
Am the home of the exiled lark.
Its grave is my home, and I’m an exile.”
Our city fled,
And I saw my feet transform
Into a river overflowing with blood,
Into ships growing distant, expanding,
And I saw my drowned shores seducing ...
My waves were wind and pelicans.
Our city fled,
And refusal is a crushed pearl
Whose powder anchors my ships,
And refusal is a woodcutter living
On my face—it gathers me and sets me on fire—
And refusal is the distance that disperses me.
I see my blood and I see my death
Beyond my blood:
It speaks to me and pursues me.
Our city fled,
And I saw how my shroud illumines me,
I saw ... If only death would grant me time.

over Jane’s bed with the candle, that monstrous
creature—well, there are flaws in the mind of Jane, too,
and the awful figure bending over her
might be the tormented wife of Rochester.
There’s a flaw in Jane’s mind, too,
looking down on the young French child
born to another tormented mother
whom Rochester says has inherited sin.
The young French child likes presents too much,
likes to dance and sing—and so what? She is love-starved,
this child who has supposedly inherited sin,
who will never get the approval of Mr. Rochester.
We lose track of the pretty child who likes to sing.
Jane goes away for a while to prove her purity.
Then, when the other wife dies, Mr. Rochester
will approve. Reader, I married him, she says,
after she has gone away for a while. He is blind
from the fire the crazy wife set. And then, miraculously,
her love asks if she is wearing a blue dress.
I believe she is pregnant, then, carrying a child
who will be a good child, miraculously.
Charlotte Brontë knew only part of the happy ending.
Perhaps he gets better and sees the blue dress.
We have to believe things turn out well,
while Charlotte, herself, had nine months of pleasure
and died. And so the book, which ends as if resolved,
asks us to believe things turn out well, the French girl gone,
Rochester and Jane and the baby in the burned-out
mansion, because books then ended resolutely
and did not reflect how it is to have a calm life,
Rochester and Jane and the baby in the burned-out
mansion, illustrated by the art of the woodcut,
which does not suggest such a calm life,
but a knife and fire making art out of wood,
in a mansion that itself has been sculpted by
fire and breaking things, which is how we really live.

Nation of Domination
my mom hugs me & wants me to stay. i have my foot
on the pedal. a fake gold chain on my neck. i confess
i’m a sucker. i never want magicians to reveal their secrets.
i want to live in the unknowing where everything is possible.
my mom dances with me to Los Bukis. she thinks this makes
me her baby still. perspective is a magic trick. i hit my brother
with the Rock Bottom & i bet you can guess what i leave out.
ask Farooq if you need a hint. the brain is full of magic
i don’t understand. no one signs up to take a dive. in wrestling,
there’s a team of writers who decide who wins and who loses.
the metaphor is obvious. my mom wasn’t born to play the role
of mom, i don’t care how many baby dolls she played with.
i dance with my mom to Los Bukis & you’re a fool
if you believe it’s her son she’s trying to hold on to.

the poets are right about the moonlight.
i take my spot of sky & deposit it
into a savings account. only after
the bank confiscated our house
did i understand. roses
don’t grow without pricked hands.
i didn’t have to spend a summer in a freezer
packing lunch meat to know the value
of sunlight. my mom didn’t have
to spend a decade wiping down floors to appreciate
education. when i give you a bouquet of roses,
i give you a bouquet of bloody hands.
a handful of dirt & the worms that doted on your roses.
when i take my piece of sky out of the bank,
it’s smaller. the drunks are right about moonshine.

every few feet of New York. cold is your hand in my hand
& yes, i am a man, & you are a woman. my wilderness
is not unlike the woods that surround us. the sky in my wild
lit by lanterns in the faces of animals. my own flammable face.

& yes, we leave the city, & we would leave the planet, too.

In her head
Runs with no interval,
A lot of people singing tunelessly
About the same things.

Comment like
A rotting peach.

Cockatoo of her impatience,
Flap flap. The slab
Of blue behind her
Is a sea of
Her doubts. The squirrel

You are dark as religion. Remember God
could not have named a modicum of light without you.
You are plum, black currant, passion
fruit in another woman’s garden. You are Black
as and as if by magic. Black not as sin, but a cave’s jaw
clamped shut by forgiveness. Color of closed wombs and bellies
of ships, you, dark as not the tree trunk but its every cleft.
I chart each crescent moon rising above fingernail
and rub together my thighs for want of you. I try
to find you where the pages of books meet. You hang
where men or piano keys segregate. When I miss you,
I remember the hickey the sun left on the back of my neck.
If I forget, I smoke blunts down to my fingertips
and beg you to come on my lips. This is how I pray for you
when I’m not pessimistic. I bow to your darkness like I kneel
beside a child’s bed, confessing as gospel, there’s no monster here.

The sinner’s bouquet, house of shredded & tornDear John letters, upended grave of names, moonBlack kiss of a pistol’s flat side, time blueborn
& threaded into a curse, Lazarus of hustlers, the picayune
Spinning into beatdown; breath of a thief stilledBy fluorescent lights, a system of 40 blocks,Empty vials, a hand full of purple cranesbills,
Memories of crates suspended from stairs, tied in knots
Around streetlamps, the house of unending push-ups,Wheelbarrows & walking 20s, the daughtersChasing their fathers’ shadows, sons that upset
The wind with their secrets, the paraphrase of fractured,Scarred wings flying through smoke, each wild hourOf lockdown, hunger time & the blackened flower.

Of lockdown, hunger time & the blackened flower —Ain’t nothing worth knowing. Prison becomes home;
The cell: a catacomb that cages and the metronomeTracking the years that eclipse you. History authors
Your death, throws you into that din of lost hours.Your mother blames it all on your X chromosome,
Blames it on something in the blood, a Styrofoam
Cup filled with whiskey leading you to court disfavor,
To become drunk on count-time & chow-call logic.There is no name for this thing that you’ve become:
Convict, hostage, inmate, lifer, yardbird, all fail.If you can’t be free, be a mystery. An amnesic.
Anything. But avoid succumbing to the humdrum:
Swallowing a bullet or even just choosing to inhale.
3
Swallowing a bullet or even just choosing to inhale,Both mark you: pistol or the blunt to the head
Escorting you through the night. Your Yale—An omen, the memories, the depression, the dead
And how things keep getting in the way of things.
When he asked you for the pistol, and you said no,The reluctance wasn’t about what violence brings.
His weeping in your ear made you regret what you owed.
On some days, the hard ones, you curse the phone,The people calling collect, reaching out, all buried,
Surrounded by bricks. On some days, you’ve known
You wouldn’t answer, the blinking numbers as varied
As the names of the prisons holding on to those lives,
Holding on, ensuring that nothing survives.
4Holding on, ensuring that nothing survives,
Not even regret. That’s the thing that gets you,
Holding on to memories like they’re your archives,Like they’re there to tell you something true
About what happened. My past put a skewOn how I held her. Unaccustomed to touch,
I knew only dream & fantasy. Try to see through
That mire and find intimacy. It was just so much.& then, the yesterdays just become yesterday,
A story that you tell yourself about not dying,
Another thing, when it’s mentioned, to downplay.
That’s what me and that woman did, trying
To love each other. What kind of fool am I,
Lost in what’s gone, reinventing myself with lies.
5
Lost in what’s gone, reinventing myself with lies:
I walk these streets, ruined by what I’d hide.
Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine.
I barely see my daughters at all these days.Out here caught up, lost in an old cliché.
But tell me, what won’t these felonies betray?
Did a stretch in prison to be released to a cell.Returned to a freedom penned by Orwell.
My noon temptation is now the Metro’s third rail.
In my wallet, I carry around my daguerreotype,A mugshot, no smiles, my name a tithe.
What must I pay for being this stereotype?
The pistols I carried into the night, my anchor;
The crimes that unraveled me, my banner.
6
The crimes that unraveled me—my banner.Only a fool confesses to owning that fact.
Honesty a sinkhole; the truth doomed to subtract
Everything but prayer, turn my breath into failure.Whiskey after prison made me crave amber,
Brown washing my glass until I’m smacked.The murder of crows on my arm an artifactOf freedom: what outlasts even the jailor.Alas, there is no baptism for me tonight.
No water to drown all these memories.The rooms in my head keep secrets that indict
Me still; my chorus of unspoken larcenies.You carry that knowledge into your twilight,
& live without regret for your guilty pleas.
7
& live without regret for your guilty pleas—Shit. Mornings I rise twice: once for a count
That will not come & later with the city’sWild birds, who find freedom without counsel.
I left prison with debts no honest man could pay.Walked out imaging I’d lapped my troubles,
but a girl once said no to my closed ears, dismayedthat I didn’t pause. Remorse can’t calm those evils.I’ve lost myself in some kind of algebra
That turns my life into an equation that zeroesOut, regardless of my efforts. Algophobia
Means to fear pain. I still fear who knowsAll I’ve done. Why regret this thing I’ve worn?

                ","
A collective family myth
passed down across generations
takes on the polished gleam of truth,
and memories become legend.
The legend of black sod-busters
on a piece of red soil they own
in a township of black ranchers.
Their legendary rodeo.grand entry
Two Stars and Stripes flutter into
the arena, carried by two
men in jeans, red shirts, white Stetsons.
Guiding their horses with left hands,
holding the flagstaffs in their rights,
their backs straight and tall, their faces,
their chestnut faces, beautiful
in the light of the setting sun.
After them, two by two,
banners waving, hooves raising dust,
ride the Horse People of Boley,
a varicolored promenade.
They canter once around the ring,
then they circle into the sky.mutton busting
In the cluster of five-year-old
contenders wearing life jackets
and bicycle helmets, paper
numbers safety-pinned to their backs,
you line up one by one for a turn
to hang on tight with your legs squeezed
at the sheep’s broad middle, fingers
holding handfuls of deep, warm wool
as the sheep destiny presents
runs you out to cheering applause.
Whether you’ll fall on top of it,
or it on you, you won’t fall far.
You have no front teeth anyway,
and a brown clown gone pick you up.bareback riding
This horse was bred and born to buck.
He’s a good horse, he’ll give you points.
Gloved hand in the rigging’s handle,
bare brown hand waving in the air,
you whir your spurs at his shoulders
as he leaps, twists, and jolts your bones.
Four seconds or four hundred years.
But if you can get up and slap
the dust off your jeans with your hat,
the future’s eyes, looking at you,
will fill with forevering light:
light that will make generations
of proud brown people remember
the Black Horse People of Boley.bulldogging
In truth there’s seldom a reason
for a man to wrestle a steer,
unless he’s a real ranch cowboy
dealing with ornery power.
Maybe, while rounding up the herd,
he bumps heads with testosterone,
and it’s testosterone-vs.-
testosterone. Bill Pickett learned,
watching dogs on a Boley ranch,
that sometimes you’ve got to bulldog
a hardhead with a kiss of pain.
Today, you slide from horse onto
the fleeing steer, grab his horns, pull
five hundred pounds of muscle down.team roping, calf roping, steer roping
Roping always involves a team,
whether it’s two men or women
or one human and one smart horse.
The aim: to bring down and hog-tie
a big scared baby of a calf
or a full-grown and pissed-off steer.
You gallop out swinging your loop
with one hand, the other holding
the slack and the unneeded reins.
You down him with a careful toss,
tie three of his hooves together,
step back with wide arms and a grin.
A rope isn’t always a noose:
ropes in brown hands can be lassos.saddle bronc riding
It’s not the leather riding gloves
and it’s not the fringed buckskin chaps,
not the worn-in and dusty boots,
not the spurs’ blunted silver stars,
not the 10x wide-brimmed straw hat
(both winged helmet and regal crown):
it’s not clothes that make the cowboy.
It’s something behind a bronzed face,
in the level gaze from dark eyes,
and, of course, it’s heart that puts you,
the reins in one hand, one hand free,
waving with the horse’s rhythm,
your heels spurring from neck to flank,
on this bronc called America.barrel racing
Thunder explodes out of the chute.
Mane and tail whip in the speed wind,
agile hooves pound a swift tempo
circling around the first barrel.
One hand grips the horn, the other
communicates with the taut reins,
though your thighs give the best guidance,
telling your horse to maneuver
in circles that hug the barrels.
Three barrels, a tight cloverleaf
you gallop through with one joined will.
This contest pits you and your horse
against the clock and your best time.
Sister, your dreadlocks are flying!pony express
Before telegraph, news traveled
from mouth to ear, from hand to hand.
News arrived old. From sea to sea
took weeks, unless carried by boys
stationed along the stagecoach route
to race a cross-country relay.
Your pulse gallops toward the handoff,
when your teammate takes the baton
and the noise and flurry go on
without you. Your leg run, you and
your horse (your partner, your friend) stand
encompassed in adrenalin,
watching, as the Ancestors must,
unable to help, but cheering.tennessee walker
Let’s hear it for the barrel men,
for the bullfighters, for the clowns,
for the men on the side ready
to run toward trouble. Give it up
for the musical director
(thanks for the hip-hop, bro!). And for
the announcer and all the folks
cheering in the stands. That baby
wearing a tiny cowboy hat.
That man the same black as his horse,
in that white suit and fedora.
His Tennessee Walker’s proud gait
as he nods to his own rhythm,
tail an ebony waterfall.bull riding
Boley bulls are bred for bucking,
bred to be mean, to be “Bad Boys.”
They teach you to sit strong, hold on,
and with one hand reach for the sky.
After riding a Boley bull
a cowboy thinks, Hell, I’ve been there.
I’ve held the bull-rope, raked my spurs,
while that bad boy tried to kill me.
A ton of Brahma seeing red
gives you a whole new perspective,
a who-you-think-you-talking-to
fearlessness. You’ve seen the bull’s eye:
you know you can’t die more than once.
You’ve lived through eight Mississippis.

only when she reprimanded me or talked of the coat.
Consider the white lab coat hanging
above a crusted heater; consider our dilapidating shame.
Consider me. Tonight, I exercise humility,
so I identify with the pigeons
nagging on the chicken bone gray as the sky.
Unparagraphed I am, the way I still steal
my dinner from a health store on 6th Ave,
then lecture the diorama with my lentil soup.
The truth is, I never educated myself

marching through an unlocked window—

His name was Apollo. Some circumstances never abandon

Is a wing a muscle? 3 Best Exercises to Building Badass Wings,

a glorious bone. In his odor, I feel at home.
Consider his careful dedication to repose.
There is something he has mastered genuinely,
his fist curled around it.  Sleeps on two cushions,
one for his ass. She was a woman of Principles. 
Consider her stark god of oblivion.

The world hadn’t hurt us more than
it had hurt anyone else, but still, I couldn’t trust
the sky and its reverberations.
In line, I made friends with a family
of crickets in white lab coats.
They sang to me, of the end of it,
that wings were awaiting us there:
stale bread rolls, a cheese pie,
Braeburn apples sharing space
with two cans of tomatoes.

At one time,
if my nails had been painted
this shade of rose-foam in Kabul
they would have rammed
out the frosted shell
like the tarp off

they would have gouged out

the cicatrix and lodge the

of neon riot in aporia,
where the humility

crab-like, platinum,
growing beneath the
watery ceiling of the palm
into amiable shoots;

growing clearer each day

the permutations will again
show their round, maddening

He wants to finish this one song
because it has his favorite parts,
which he has rewound a few times now,

yelling, holding a peeling board game

over to the chorus, remembering how Mahmoud
once told him how his father comes home
only once a month, and he feels bad
he is taking so long to go downstairs
but this would be the last time
he rewinds the song, Mahmoud, wallahi,
he yells, the cassette player’s volume
on high but not loud enough
to drown out the street-market prices,
the chatter of bent men
at the coffeehouse, their fingers caterpillar-like
through the mugs, blowing
on clouded tea,
but the music is just enough
to shroud it all in the blur
of a filmy fog that Mahmoud can hear
and he can’t help but remember
how sometimes at night,
if he closes his eyes hard enough,
he hears the din of keys
against the door,
the whistling of a man
nearly always caught
in the middle

To be a statue               carved by Bernini
Lounging in a climate-controlled museum in Rome         is luxury
Like the luxury of a personal pan pizza            with unlimited free toppings
Or the luxurious feel of a premium eye pencil          used to draw bisons on the walls of a French cave
To be so white and glossy                   is unimaginable
Like how I imagine a plate of eggs painted by Velázquez           or the lid of a designer toilet cistern
In a European magazine                       (I could be European
And wear a dashingly arranged scarf          or sip weirdly-named liqueurs that taste like semen
In a Rococo palais)                but in the scheme of things
Where I am marble and still                  my wrist will be a marvel
Like the marvel of an isthmus           whose name can only be pronounced if you have a lisp
Or the marvelous sausage                that saved a man from the Inquisition in 1582
It is definitely marvelous                    to be as attenuated
As the casually extended leg of a greyhound                   reclining on its very own velvet settee
To be so thoroughbred                          is an accomplishment

Or the extremely frivolous ceiling                   of a banqueting hall where royals are put to death
If it is admirable to be so luxurious                    then I will never be admired
The way a designer toilet cistern is admired               or a piece of elaborate pâtisserie
(Although I am not a statue                   I have often held my arms aloft
As when catching a carelessly thrown baby              or pointing at two meteors at the same time)
It is exhausting trying to be so inanimate               and desirable

accepts Megan as she moves.
    If Megan is a system of exchange

 updates its inversion of the air
 even more than did the air displace
when she grew from brown-eyed baby
into strong laboring woman in blue jeans
  and heathered wool,
and if the air and earth draw from Megan’s corpse
  all the energy and minerals
 she pulled from her surrounds
to build her nails and bones and teeth—
 if the exchange doesn’t stop

it found relation,

A different pack of humans cut the shortest
Fully grown tree down then he watched the tree as
The humans dragged it to their camp he watched the
Tree as the humans broke the tree apart he
Watched as the humans carved the parts of the tree in-

The hastily assembled angel wandered
The desert hidden in      the pillar of

Fire in the night      and as he wandered he
Asked himself whether      sometimes as he wandered
He asked himself      whether he really could
Be said to wander      since he after all
Could see through time      which was even better for
Seeing where he was going than seeing      through space
In the day he was a darkness in the cloud
Like rain      and in the night he was a darkness

Hadn’t been given or no even God      had-

Give God a gift      except he knew he was
Allowed to see through time because he was

We gathered in a field southwest of town,
several hundred hauling coolers
and folding chairs along a gravel road
dry in August, two ruts of soft dust
that soaked into our clothes
and rose in plumes behind us.
By noon we could discern their massive coils
emerging from a bale of cloud,
scales scattering crescent dapples
through walnut fronds,
the light polarized, each leaf tip in focus.
As their bodies blotted out the sun,
the forest faded to silverpoint.
A current of cool air
extended from the bottomlands
an intimation of October,
and the bowl of sky deepened
its celestial archaeology.
Their tails, like banners of a vast army,
swept past Orion and his retinue
to sighs and scattered applause,
the faint wail of a child crying.
In half an hour they had passed on
in search of deep waters.
Before our company dispersed,
dust whirling in the wind,
we planned to meet again in seven years

I thought very hard and thought of nothing.
—Jesse Ball, Census
In one segment of the landscape, a hyena drags her clitoris
across the plains, a dust perfuming up. Cicadas pulse the segment,
a femur filled with rain. It is a lush grassland within which
the greens have sprouted through the exposed joints of animals.
This seems to be a metaphor for growth and resistance. A
single singed dollar rolls through the wind. I read
a book that imagines, among other things, a world without
trees. I wrote a book that imagines, among other things, a world
without men. The book splayed open on my parents’ dresser,
an early part of the book. People do this when they no longer
want to see information. I no longer want to see information.
In another segment, a series of weasel oil candles, such is
the cure-all in this aspect of land. Mostly the candles are not
lit. At night the moon makes the earth shine like bottle
flies, a glimmer here and there where a lachrymose flame
continues on. A god peeks past the clit of the hyena
disapprovingly, as evidenced by their glare and nod. But I
want a god to glare and nod. I want a god to do anything at all
with my debts. In another segment, my grandmother
lives and she watches a pack of lionesses feasting inside
the rib cage of a zebra. At first, she tells us, she believes
the zebra to be sleeping on her side, but the lions move
her skin under the membrane of bones.
It’s like I always say: The evenings wait for the kind of
death we get and we are so very fond of the evenings.
In another segment, the last one, we know it to be last
because a single woman is braiding her hair in a desert.
We have been here before. An animal raises her leg.

A scorpion lifts its tail, braids more active than braiding,

to the kind of life we want until we turn our heads east.
The night fills without us but I warned you, I was full
already. A banana inside me blasted open a door,
my thoughts at the threshold of such a door blank. Love
transacts, a figure in the distance crowded with window.
An enzyme eats plastic, but which kind? Synthetic polymer

First the people had to invent ladders. No one had ever seen a ladder. Once they had ladders they invented walls to climb over. Soon they realized it took two ladders to climb a wall. One to climb up one side—one to climb down the other. People would ascend one side of the wall, descend the other side of the wall, and then walk away, leaving the ladders behind. That is why there are so many ladders in the world. The ladders are picked up and stored in an enormous warehouse. Scientists have proposed attaching all the ladders, one on top of the other, creating an elevator into outer space. Some people want to destroy all the ladders. Others want to destroy the walls.

“Plastic Garbage Patch Bigger Than Mexico Found in Pacific.”National Geographic: These pieces of plastic are not necessarily
floating bottles, bags, and buoys, but “teeny-tiny pieces of plastic resembling
confetti.” 90% of sea birds consume it. “Over eight million tons of new plastic
trash finding its way into the oceans every year.”
The Great Pacific Garbage Patch moves in a clockwise direction,
like a toilet. It circulates an area of 7.7 million square miles.
“70% of marine debris sinks to the bottom of the ocean.”New York Times: Plastiglomerate was “discovered” by Charles Moore,
a sea captain, surveying plastic washed up on a remote, polluted
stretch of sand on Hawaii’s Big Island. It is a new stone, a fusion
of natural and manufactured materials. “If [plastiglomerates] are
buried within the strata,” says Jan Zalasiewicz, an English geologist,
“I don’t see why they can’t persist in some form for millions of years.”

Aggregates increase “like snow.” Aggregation theory represents
a two-state system [“time for chemistry, kids”] ... to characterize
the formation of marine aggregates and the loss due to sinking:
 
  
where· C1 is the concentration of the cells· r is the radius of each cell· G is the shearing rate· α is the stickiness coefficient· g is the growth rate.
Thus, aggregation of marine particles is more prevalent when
cell and particle concentration is higher (e.g. algal blooms).

Wikipedia: marine snow is a variety of mostly organic matter,
including dead or dying animals, and plankton ... also plant parts
and degrading plant material. Because of the relatively long
residence time of the ocean’s thermohaline circulation, carbon
transported as marine snow into the aphotic zone by the biological
pump can remain out of contact ... for more than a thousand years.A blue jay lands in the fringe tree. Sudden downfall of petals.

Be wells none see. Unstoppered tears,
O oud, we gather in your bowl.
O ladle of ores, scoop ink here
now seeping from the foreigner,
be sighs, O oud, and cloven aches
in the dark of millions of ears.
Be gift for famished wails and wakes
to lacks and flares and tented stakes,

Long after I stopped participating
Those images pursued me
I found myself turning from them
Even in the small light before dawn
To meet the face of my own body
Still taut and strong, almost too
Strong a house for so much shame
Not mine alone but also yours
And my brother’s, lots of people’s,
I know it was irrational, for whom I saw
Myself responsible and to whom
I wished to remain hospitable.
We had all been pursuing our own
Disintegration for so long by then
That by the time the other side
Began to raise a more coherent
Complaint against us we devolved
With such ease and swiftness it seemed
To alarm even our enemies. By then
Many of us had succumbed to quivering
Idiocy while others drew vitality from new
Careers as public scolds. Behind these
Middle-management professors were at pains
To display their faultless views lest they too
Find censure, infamy, unemployment and death
At the hands of an enraged public
Individuals in such pain and torment
And such confusion hardly anyone dared
Ask more of them than that they not shoot
And in fact many of us willed them to shoot
And some of us were the shooters
And shoot we did, and got us square
In the heart and in the face, which anyway
We had been preparing these long years
For bullets and explosions and whatever
Else. A vast unpaid army
Of self-destructors, false comrades, impotent
Brainiacs who wished to appear to be kind
Everything we did for our government
And the corporations that served it we did for free
In exchange for the privilege of watching one
Another break down. Sometimes we were the ones
Doing the breaking. We would comfort one another
Afterward, congratulating each other on the fortitude
It took to display such vulnerability. The demonstration
Of an infirmity followed by a self-justificatory recuperation
Of our own means and our own ends, in short, of ourselves
And our respect for ourselves—this amounted to the dominant
Rhetoric of the age, which some called sharing, which partook
Of modes of oratory and of polemic, of intimate
Journals and of statements from on high issued by public
Figures, whom at one time or another we all mistook ourselves for.
Anyway it wasn’t working. None of it was working.
Not our ostentation and not the uses we put our suffering
To, the guilt- and schadenfreude-based attention
We extracted from our friends and followers, and even the passing
Sensation of true sincerity, of actual truth, quickly emulsified
Into the great and the terrible metastasizing whole.
To the point it began to seem wisest to publish only
Within the confines of our own flesh, but our interiors
Had their biometrics too, and were functions not only
Of stardust, the universe as we now were prone to addressing
The godhead, but also of every mean and median of the selfsame
Vicious culture that drove us to retreat into the jail of our own bones
And the cramped confines of our swollen veins and ducts in the first place
Our skin was the same wall they talked about on the news
And our hearts were the bombs whose threat never withdrew
Images could drop from above like the pendulum in “The Pit
And the Pendulum” or killer drones to shatter the face of our lover
Into contemporaneous pasts, futures, celebrities, and other
Lovers all of whom our attention paid equally in confusion
And longing, and a fleeting sense like passing ghosts
Of a barely-remarked-upon catastrophe that was over
Both before and after it was too late. We were ancient
Creatures, built for love and war. Everything said so
And we could not face how abstract it was all becoming
Because it was also all the opposite of abstract, it was
Our flesh, our mother’s bloodied forehead
On the floor of Penn Station, and wherever we hid
Our face, amid a crowd of stars for example as Yeats
Once put it, and for stars insert celebrities
Or astrology here, your choice, and even when
We closed our eyes, all this was all we looked at
Every day all day. It was all we could see.
We were lost in a language of images.
It was growing difficult to speak. Yet talk
Was everywhere. Some of us still sought
To dominate one another intellectually
Others physically; still others psychically or some
Of all of the above, everything seeming to congeal
Into bad versions of sports by other means
And sports by that time was the only metaphor
Left that could acceptably be applied to anything.
The images gave us no rest yet failed over
And over despite the immensity
Of their realism to describe the world as we really
Knew it, and worse, as it knew us

One of my aunts thinks skydiving is a synonym for when it rains
the other way
One of my aunts faked her visa & went to the vet once
thinking it was the doctor
she asks me how come dogs here have doctors
I say because dogs here are domesticated
the opposite of domestic is alien the opposite of flower
is fist the opposite of purple is pray
orchid comes from the Greek word meaning [testicle]
Greek women believed eating orchids made their unborn
babies boys
for a son, my mother creamed her toes suckled coals liquefied flies fucked on full moon
days flossed with a dagger darkened her bathwater ashed her cheekbones torched her crotch
candied the blood boiled it with sugar & still
she wept when she saw my face
filmed it with her fingers
weeded out my eyes & witched them into rivers
my grandfather farmed orchids in a city named thirst
when the war came, he pissed on his field
to keep the orchids alive, he spent all his body’s water
his organs dehydrated into stones I skip across sea-mirrors
flowers bruise in the wind & weaponless
crimes are called births
water perpetrates want
the army unburied our bodies in a field of salty orchids
everyone in my family resembles a river’s
rag-dolled neck
in photos our faces overlap like venn diagrams of grief
there is a breed of orchid called the ghost orchid & another breed called the blood orchid
one is fictional & the other is edible & the other
night I vased my throat like a stem & did not think of extinct species
decades later reappearing like the lungfish
one of the original fish that left the sea for land
all migrations begin as mothers as mimicry
a fish saw a tree & decided to stand
without feet my brother says orchids
look like pussies smell like
pussies too he says I should know
I do know I know the color of thirst
is not salt but cylinder but a city leased to fire
to architect the ash into an alibi

There’s nothing dandier than threadbare threads
worn by a discerning shabby dresser.
A collar’s fret or subtle fray is not lesser
because it’s worn away but models instead
the bespoke tailoring of time itself.
Done poorly—the gentleman farmer’s
piecemeal pastoral, that NoHo charmer’s
duct-taped boots—it’s like an unread bookshelf
of secondhand prose: a too-studied pose.
Done well, it draws you in to draw you near,
reveals the intricate pattern in the years’
inexorable ravel. Between decompose
and deconstruct, what seemed a foppish quirk
grows wise. Design undone. We wear time’s work.

I tell him to touch his toes. He reaches for them in a squat.
He stabs them with his little fingers. One toe. Two toes.
Then we say our letters, spell out all the sounds we will deliverbecause the death of a child is no small death.
I extend to him an open palm where he makes a fist
and slams it into my hand, a form, he wearily shouts,
is “a butterfly coming home!” We play “give me a five”
and continue swatting at the butterfliesuntil the sun goes down.
I don’t recall ever playing with my mother like this.
Late one morning, my son caught me pinching
the sides of my head, my face wet from so much crying.
He punched my arm, which knocked one hand off
of my face. Ashamed that he saw me, I laughed very loudly
which brought him concern and happiness. He never
mentioned it again and I never forgave myself.My good son, running through the garden
in giggles. He is waiting for me to catch him. Once
I pretended to have fallen in a pit. I did not tell him
it was a grave. Very quickly he sprinted over and stood
beside my body. “Your hand!” he demanded.
Like a little father. I gave him my hand.
“Now, the other hand!” I give him the other.

                    And the Moon on Its Stem Will Steal You Away
                ","
That’s a good one, the idea of the moon having a stem and somehow
stealing you, whoever you are, kind of like Persephone or Orpheus,
portrayed or alluded to in countless forms of art and popular culture
including poetry, film, opera, music, and painting. And it kind of fits
my mood this morning, something vaguely cartoonish and devoid
of real gravitas, but still, a kind of realism, even so. And the area
around is the void, outer space, nothing, because explaining things
is never as interesting as wanting them, the desire to know, set against
a backdrop of black velvet and rhinestones. Let’s say that you wake up
one day and realize you don’t remember anything that happened
yesterday. Maybe for five minutes or so. And for those five minutes
you’re thinking, as I was thinking this morning, that this is it. Car keys.
The word for when you really want something and work for it.
Your dog’s name. There are not enough blank pages for all this
forgetting, like debris falling back to earth, you and yours hiding in
the underbrush with hopes of your own, of rescue or escape.
When you don’t remember why you’re hiding in the underbrush,
you’ve been hiding in the underbrush forever. This whole other
existence leaps forward in possibility. And then the five minutes
are up, and it’s oh yeah, eggs, Saturday. Some day that was.
A chemist once told me luminol was her favorite color. It glows
a beautiful greenish-blue when it comes into contact with blood
by reacting to the iron in hemoglobin, looking a bit like the sky
this morning. It’s a kind of truth of blue, that uncovers, that
remembers. It’s used by investigators to detect blood at crime scenes
where no blood is visible. There are so many things to forget,
to lose, and in so many different ways. But even so, one can be wrong
about the past, and deduce from error, but still be right about
the future or the present. And when you don’t remember what day
it is, happy birthday. Despite all our best efforts, there’s a wolf
on the horizon making a movie of your approach, and it’s
a shipwreck playing across me as I’m pouring sugar into my cup.

what she told me. What I honor. They, as unambiguous as Lyrae is:
black, bard, badass; svelte with flourishing braids; a singularity and
somehow all of them gathered as one like tributaries to the mouth of
the river of God—Gwendolyn and Lucille and June and—and I can’t
count all the ways I was saved that day, emerging wet from the ritual
to find myself sitting in some stranger’s living room, a writer who’d
been pushed out of their homeland by its persecutions, pulled into
America on the promise of asylum, the same America that commits
my own kind to institutions with routine and rarely second thoughts
signaling the presence of conscience, and while we’re on the subject
of right and wrong, know I’d read the news recently and retreated far
into my unfeeling before I received the blessing of her timely word,
walking in bloody boots through hallways leading to the chambers
where tenderness is said to rest in all of us by symbology, but then
I was called outside my bones again. And let me tell you, my friend:
you’ve never seen light before you’ve seen it. I swear, it’s as if with
the snap of a finger I could recite the very definition of gold without
needing to run yolk from the promise of a child, a happy day’s glow
spilling into the street like July’s laughter from a fire hydrant as we
left the house with folk who loved words and loved us—loved us—
so expansively. And less than two nights later we’re all throwing our
asses in a circle, cuttin’ up, working up what was an effortless sweat,
undeterred even as the music skipped on every hiccup of the fraying
wires, tethered just as strenuously to joy as ever, like always, trying
to catch a good breath, but I paid it no mind, no mind, no mind—no,
I wasn’t absent upstairs exactly, I was hyper-present; what a ghost is
to death I was to life, inside everything simultaneously—the sub and
the synth, the blown-off roof and hole-stomped floor, the rise of
their chests and the fall—and only nigga returned me to this plane:my nigga, my nigga, a lyric left on my bottom lip like the sweet after-
burn of Hennessy, but yo, it’s like I was being called for, called out
of need since I know that word only has such resonance in a world
where we ain’t free. And, nah, we ain’t free, if you were wondering.
There are no shackles on me your eyes can see but none that I can’t
feel as if they were appendages divided from me by the occurrence
of civil war, a set of chimeless chains that could be yanked on and
bring me, even at my most upright, to my knees. And if it happens—
again—I suppose I could pray, there, at my literally lowest moment,
immersed in the mess they’ve made that I’m tasked with cleaning
up for the commendation of pennies. I hope I don’t get shot while
genuflect since that’s apparently a thing now in this country, but I
worry such a selfish ask won’t have sufficient fuel to reach heaven,
that the bastardized sparrow will burn up in the atmosphere as easily
as tissue paper. And I recognize I’m rambling now, but I’m likewise
increasing my odds of bumping into the point of all this since inside
the milk of me something was stirred by what she said, but it’s hard
to translate a muscular language to a verbal one just as it’s hard to
relate to folk who don’t consider their own demise fifty ’leven times
a day at least, and for that relapse not to be an injurious ideation but
an itch of practicality. What I wouldn’t pay for the chance to not pay
attention to every little thing—how they talk near me and how they
talk when they believe I’m nowhere near, what they do or don’t do
with each other that they do or don’t do with me, the questions they
feel quite content to ask me and the ones they never seem to though
I leave the door open, the window, the bleeding heart. I know them
so well, people who wouldn’t know me from the next in the lineup;
I know them so intimately you’d think I love them all, and the gag is
that I do, by some undesired miracle, and that is part of all this, too.
To say they don’t deserve my time is an obvious statement, but they
take it anyway because it’s all they know, evident as I recount every
transgression taking seconds off my time on this earth, summing up
to years, almost to the point I’m gone already, in response to which
I either swallow spit or spit out ellipses. Ask the wounded wall what
I know of restraint, the manifesto I’d pen with what pours out from
my punctured knuckles, though, perhaps, the poet was signaling that,
all along, I’ve been teaching the most important life lesson merely by
domesticating rage, confining it inside the margins of the flesh that
my parents made for me, the page my life is written against each day
in corrective red ink. And this seems like the appropriate moment
to divulge that her sermon came during a dialogue about poetic craft
of all things, but if poetry can’t be applied to how one moves through
this world then I see very little worth in it, which is where it started
for me. Poetry was a dead white thing in my life once, at the bottom
of the trash can with the doll of Jesus they’d tried pawning off on me
back in Catholic school, but luckily I already knew one for us, by us,
and thus found the inner-strength to soldier through the barren winter
of lyrical delight rocking a pair of big-ass Timberlands and other on-
trend threads a person of greater gravitas could’ve filled out better
around the shoulders. But I digress—since what I really mean to be
speaking on is how the Cavalier poets weren’t really doing it for me
during high school, not because their explicit sexuality or their taste
for material excess and ambitious proximity to the throne were such
disagreeable subjects to me, at the time revisiting rap’s mafioso era,
but because when we painted those same pictures as we preferred to,
our tongues spiraling like ballerinas and bullets, they sought the ban
on sale or talked down on it as being absent of any artistic merit, as if
a nation’s worth of people surviving subjugation is more science than
art anyway, for if that were true, then we wouldn’t have a culture and
America wouldn’t have great product to push to the rest of the planet
aside from all the bombs it seems much keener on dropping casually
like Funkmaster Flex, and I’d already grown tired in my young age,
so tired, of trying to prove I’m not stupid even above trying to prove
I’m smart. And those who doubt there’s a difference have digging
to do, deep into their pockets to get me what I’m owed for damages,
for emotional distress and all things it’s been made feasible to sue for
with solid legal representation. Funny, I once longed to be a lawyer,
little fool that I was, my back against a brick wall painted by spotlight,
rifles lined and aiming, in that night’s vision—legal fluency seemed
the only option for release from this burden because it’s the language
my nemeses speak in. I do know bad English from black, but I know
power even better because I’ve brushed up against it just as a person
in any number of neighborhoods around here may have brushed up
against a police officer. Maybe it’s needless to say I didn’t go down
an attorney path; I actually don’t have a plan at all these days except
evading the bullet and also the bullet points corporations thrive on,
as if any of this is simple, as if I, symptom of systemic dysfunctions
enveloped by skeleton and skin, am something simple. I’d only ever
be two-dimensional if airbrushed on a blank T-shirt and even that
would show depth to someone’s esteem for who I was with no one
else nearby, and all this means is that there is more to me or anyone
alike than being menace or miscreant, minstrel or misanthrope, or
murdered as all four would be with equal fanfare. But what I really
want is to know what they feel when their black friend dies in that
typical way for it’s maybe the only thing I don’t know about them,
while we practice poker faces and draft FAQs. Forget seeing eye to
eye for a second. Set aside the particular grammars of forgiveness
we use without pulling up the problem’s root: do they still feel full
people if they put the hammer down? And when they can’t answer,
make note that I can because I have those tools and also others that
shall remain nameless in order to remain purposeful. That’s how I
prefer it, besting all desertions of their decency, which I say since
you’ve caught me rare and raw tonight, sipping off the bottle top,
slurring my songs, hitting my two-step on beat every. single. time.
Damn—how blessed they are to be able to watch me work around
them—as illegibly as what the miraculous Phillis Wheatley wrote
all over her master’s walls, owned in the moment, I feel, solely by
an ambition toward self-definition I also try applying prodigiously,
bringing them to speechlessness, a shaming kind of silence sayinglisten, leave me be because there’s no explaining me, thus there’s
no exploiting me: what only a history under thumb and foot helps
grasp before letting go, for one’s own good even more than mine.

I ran across the street, I didn’t know any better.
Ran out in the street, I didn’t know no better.
I just knew a woman was there, though I’d never met her.
She sat me in her parlor, distracted me with trinkets,
milky glass birds and fish, distracting trinkets.
She said my mother would be fine, but did she think it?
The world was a blur of crystal wings and fins.
My tears were casked in crystal, wings and fins.
She was the first of many lady-friends.
The tree shadows shortened, she brought me a drink of water.
Morning matured, she brought me a glass of water.
I drank it so fast, she went and brought another.
I kept looking out the window, she didn’t ask me what for.
I watched out that window, she didn’t ask what for.
The seconds broke off and lay there on the floor.
I imagined my mother’s route, as far as I could.
Her long morning walk, followed as far as I could.
Nothing I could do would do any good.

Everything we do and say in patriarchy can be traced
back to “Strangers in the Night.” Your faded jeans, my
faint daytime smile. (Dazzling’s so expensive.) Bad
Mailer novels; lose-money-quick schemes. A fortune in
friendship, nevertheless. Beef farmers favor self-flesh
awareness. (Or brittle in toffee queen regimes.) Thoughts
as feats of strength. The figure in the woodpile as a
white snake, two needle bites. The end of the week, of
us, strangers now or not? I’m dressed in white, I am the
right blonde in the wrong seaplane, I haven’t learnt the
language yet. The meta-leopards will have taken over
the aquarium. They’ll stroll this way like kangaroos to
green glass. Papa, I’ve upset you. There’ll be a line of
songs like crystals lining up to kiss the bell that says Big
Town. We are on the roof now, playing to Central Park
everyone hot in their coats. Paid for not stolen. They
admit to being too late for miracles, for charity. The
poem’s parents are in the front row. The poem’s friend
interprets. Can we repeat it without going back to the
start, the lover’s demand like ants beneath the plaint?
In Eden, in Athens, estrangement flowers. We turn and
return. Is it love itself, beckoning from the lurid grass-
lands? There’s a cuteness to plaster’s novelty hiding of
the body. People are cited in the mouth, stand on the
ground. They fly like Lucy. You can deny it all for fun
and parties, as if the mind was the feeling that input
gives. It’s a power no one likes to admit, as it so often
leads to failure in later life, like living in a swimming
pool, or losing your tongue in the mail. What of
romances with characters from books? Alice says hello
I remind her of a cookie in a dream she had of heaven or
hell—but which was it? Everything that happens in the
world has someone to say it’s their fault, repress it as
they may. The cutout in the cocktail bar wants to go
home with someone for once. The snakeskin hangs on
the gate like it’s a street corner, that each uttered “baby”
renews. Knowing can be a means to forgetting, also
We stand there as if the floor or wall is our companion
our fortress in trouble: mates a bit longer, keeping sex at
bay. Not everyone looks where they’re going or cares
where others are. They’re the rugged ones, though fleet
as moths when crossing a highway. Sometimes, despite
our own egos, we admire this, as if wise that the pattern
of the one ahead won’t ultimately save or brave us
Don’t rush. The star we wake to mightn’t always be
there, so we wander outside as if air were itself a prayer
or someone’s. Is that for me? addressing an ivy or a wet
plank, suddenly hungry. Tell me what happened to Peter
and Wendy and the loser with the hook for a hand. Was
it all alright in the end? They say time is nothing but it
takes the saying to make it so. To be the one is to
vanquish Sinatra, but also life (not that life is patriarchy)
Repress the possibility for the sake of staying young, as
around the bend a boat may contain the set of problems
that will have always been around. Attitudes to dancing
housework, contraception, ever music’s themes. A wall-
flower may remind themselves of wallpaper, peeling to
reveal a peasant who goes to sleep at dusk behind their
tux, but does that haunt you more than the possibility
of possessing truth? Is that what your glances are about?

Knowing my passion for celebrity nudes reached back to the last days of Netscape Navigator, Siri dutifully told me of the latest gossip site to promise their release.
Lawyers had sued to block the nudes’ coming to light and thereby confirmed they exist, she said. I resented the assured existence of any celebrity nudes I had yet to see, insisting all stars were both clothed and unclothed until the moment the webpage was loaded—at which point truth would be made clear.
Siri disapproved of my inaccurate interest in Schrödinger and his daguerreotype nudes, whose bits I’d heard were coffined up behind some Princeton research paywall full tuition granted access to. She explained I could save my money: how all nudes took form already, stored as light in fiber optic cables stashed in the oceans’ aphotic sands. HTML5 would dredge up everything.
Hypertext did not excite me, but I had to admit pleasure at the thought of seabed celebrity nudes leaked by wolffish. Would they float? Form islands? I saw archipelagos of nudes in a cold Atlantic full of them.
I asked Siri what she thought of my nudes, the lighting I’d used—their dark, private silhouettes. Bring your umbrella, she said. I looked at the thick cloud of my nakedness above, and agreed it was possible for rain.

Later, later-later, I worried about firewood, pots to cook. I asked ¿Where did my parents go? ¿Where? ¿There? I walked to another tree, another shore ... ¿Where are they now? I carved more: my face, my parents’, an alligator’s, yo soy un bicho migrante. ¡But no! I got tired of waiting, of playing, I wanted to see more. I found a river, found a road. Found more like me, a bunch of us waiting for more of us to flee. A tribe. A small village, yo soy un bicho migrante. I saw there were rules, clothes kept dry in plastic bags, phone numbers written inside pants. They also made fire, carved things into the mud. Asked ¿De donde sos vos? I pointed: de allá. Said I didn’t have plans. They answered, ¡Bienvenido! Tapped their feet on the dirt, yo soy un bicho migrante. We walked on the road, then along the road looking for food. Through the forest, through the mountains, we looked for mud, for frogs, for—¡There! ¡There they are! We played our favorite game, until I got bored again. Yo soy un bicho migrante. Nights are boring. Fireflies ... boring. Stars, the moon ... Well ... I began to let myself think ... babosadas came to mind: countries, passports. Then, I walked away from everyone, got to a mountain, then another one. Got to a river where I saw rats. ¿Have you seen the tribe? ¿A savage bunch that makes fires from trash? In a hurry they chased after me. I ran north. Found a few others. Or, maybe it was just me. To eat you have to believe, they said. Handed me something in the dark. Yo soy un bicho migrante. Saw pizza in the dark, hamburgers, clouds maybe. Maybe clouds. I saw fireflies. Few days had passed. I felt like an empty road. I invented machines. Planes. Fast cars. I barely had time to learn their names. I barely had time to say goodbye. Yo soy un bicho migrante. Years later, I filled forms. Wrote my name & woke up in a bed that had traveled 56 days, 56 nights. Then, came an election. War. Kids kept coming, but I had to find work. Wrote so many books my hands got tired. Made alternatives for plastic. Someone separated people into groups. Trees were cut extinct. But I destroyed fences, jailed kings, invented a replacement for countries. We searched for  purpose. Happiness. ¡Anyone could travel anywhere! We learned new languages. I had looked through the window I wasn’t supposed to. Yes, I looked. ¿What can I say? So I could be certain I looked & broke through. Yo soy un bicho migrante. But maybe, just maybe, I’ll return to that well & begin carving mud again. I’ll carve the whole world backwards. But no. Maybe not. Migrating has no beginning. No purpose.

ocotepeque, h.n.—I was born in a little town. This was not very long ago. I think I was four five years old. Parents let me do whatever: I looked up at the sun, I loved the sun, it burned a dot in my eyes. Mom was saying we must go catch the bus soon, instead I grabbed a piece of wood & etched it. Sucked it like my own thumb to learn something no one else had. Don’t judge my face. Girls like me. Boys like me with my long hair, I relish it. I love my father very much. More than anybody. He stayed. One morning I come home. He isn’t there. Down the road, this crowd. I drive the crowd away. This is my father, I say. Ask them this thing they allow: his body given to me. I dissect it.

She wanted to taste the fire inside the corn,
cried over photographs of other people’s cakes.
Once she punched a cake. Those memories
surface often, like a flood of bus stop pigeons.
She hoped to meet an owl before she died,
did nothing at all to further this agenda item
other than looking up. Curious about clocks,
she asked a lot of questions regarding their guts.
Was there an ocean inside them, for example?
How did the first craftsman know where to lodge
the quiet snore of gears? She asked for holy
water to be distilled down into an adhesive seal

Pollination against the seed to grow canopy
and mark place in shades of green—dry here to reflect
in glassine quartz chips in the off-red dirt where trees tree
as the forest is difference there green-inflected light you nurtured far
where volcanic would give name in poem or misty rain for each better-
suited frond of palm, its trunk, those particular roots. Here, so dry.
Not to have visited outside the lines you published,
strands of rain where trade winds dry as here easterlies
sap the energy of watering. It’s where we read, as you knew,
where the single tree in a back garden opens out to all
trees momentarily safe, or at least alive, before the chop.
I knew a man who tried to make a suburban backyard into a palm house.Arecaceae would seem like part of the joke as we measure
tank rungs and how many waterings left, aside from our drinking.
But you see them where farmhouses were built and lost or condemned
for varying reasons—twin date palms (“fate palms”) thick and robust
and the scrabble of rubble and chimney between. But no habitat of like, just addendum.
Living in a shack there was a single great chestnut, not a walnut, out of place.
A chestnut introduced like a vision of walks, the tessellations
of light collected into prayer, which is where it began for you. And for others.
The mirror of any leaf, the flipside, the reverse, is the growing and falling
enigma—even here among the non-deciduous, dry leaves fall, stroke light.
Whole branches cut off from the supply when sap is difficult to supplement, create.
That vegetation cleared for plantation leaps shadows out of wasted soil, to scaffold.Gardening. I have known so many gardeners who sought
to build hope out of the clearing, to remake an image of plenty,
of sharing fresh air and taking stale breath. Each quietly “oracular,” if in denial,
each afraid of drought though remembering greened light in their plans,
their reticulation, their watching the weather. To make a calm to spread—there if we bother to look, to listen to the birds moving in and out, some staying.
You knew back gardens, and you knew the streets made bare, as they
are here—say, of Melbourne, green-gilled city, whose old planted trees become expendable?
Or where I am, huge chunks of bush grubbed out daily with excuses made
or not bothered with—hard to keep track of outside the shade of verandas, offices.
Or among the palms on another island, Réunion, the warning of offensive odor
though a beauty that might make an activist or remaker of demi-lost verse forms.
What is there in common, across the list of names, of species—growing
conditions, from a part of the world far from where they’re coaxed into a differing
light? What is there in common if we’re not in the place of writing,
and yet we are grown into, welded rhizome by rhizome? You cannot take
the first bird I see today—a yellow-rumped thornbill tuning in, foraging
for the rest of the small flock—any more than I would choose to. It tends the image.
Each cell an art to tempt and let be to rebuild the soil. But no profiling,
and no conflict. The straggly tenuous but tough contradictions of York gums’
outer reaches supple but brittle closer to a perception of where a heart might rest,
termites holding the strings of a pacemaker, split and opening out to tempt owlet nightjars—
I heard one calling from a broken limb at 10:49 the other night and you were still breathing,
sleeping your breath to the canopy of world? That near and far line of prayer.
Once, on a very small island, a coral island big enough for a dozen palms
and a colony of land crabs and two humans, the heart of a young palm
was torn out and handed over to the one unfamiliar with its form or taste.
He ate, and the palm was gone. Coconuts were spouting, finding and making
on the atoll, at the outer. Lugging vats of water up and down the valley wall,
I think this, and your line, a late line: “nothing is missing”—a conclusion?
I wrote of that palmheart for a heart surgeon years ago because all elegies
are entwined, even those of different endocrines. The circulatory system of memorials.
If welcomed under the green light of plantings, the off-spectrum aspiration
against grief, I would have told you of the jam tree—acacia acuminata—
because we are surrounded by them against the odds, and they come back,
thriving on disturbed ground, with trouble around them. Short-lived treeshrubs,
their rough bark exchanges codes of camouflage with stick insects, as I look
now and can’t see beyond the idea of an insect being there, legs forward like antennae.
Rot here is powder rather than mulch, mostly. Saplings rise to spend time dying.
But some pull through and some will become part of the width of those great jarrahs
felled by ancestors, their essences pushing against climate to make good.
My “you” can’t be yours, but the moon and sun do their own syzygy for us all.
Language is vegetation. I knew a couple who screened their cedar kit home
from a country pub with a line then another line and another line of native trees.
I have a family who planted tens of thousands of trees to reclaim saltland settlement
hauled out of its deep sleeping, its subroots. I knew a person who filled empty
paddocks with trees deleted for a new suburb, next to the new suburb where
bushland had hung on against the trend, gone late. To have known morning in those places!
I know you’ll have known this—how thick vegetation, the uprights and bends
of trees on a still morning, can enhance our ability to pick out the between-notes
of birdwork. You wrote of clarity, and translated ornate forms, to be filled with a moment’s
singularity. Respiration. Our greatest breath might be so low or a rasp like a storm
coming in to rejuvenate, to depart with cataclysm. And so we pass with varying
degrees of light, the need for oxygen in the dismantling of carbohydrates.
Night is eating of oxygen. But more, much more out in bare day. So in our sleep
we join the trees, wrapped in leaves and fronds, held out of consciousness by tendrils.
So we thank god for photosynthesis more than we thank god for the sun as itself?
Here, we have valley, we have curved rim of valley closing out, here we have a kite, too—
a black-shouldered kite that hovers above the infrequent powerlines and self-supply,
and here we have year building on year that is an aside to a past that builds in all directions.
The inner green of room cracked in the thermal economics of presence
that underwrites reflection in crops and their residues, a shattering of light
in glassy stubble, the march against concrete and lead, against ordnance
and conquest, just roots holding soil so dry it is tempted to lift as a plume
across the district, hungering after the great dust devil that took off a roof
and opened a house down near Picnic Hill Road not long after you passed.
Interior of wood of fallen branch of loosened fibers and machines striking out
from gravel shoulders to lay great flooded gums on creek beds a trickle of old seasons
green with algae, green with signatures of flow, the bridges where great roots held sway.
What remakes such wasted soil? We try local species and intertwine with olive trees.
And in our suppressed thoughts, palmistry is a lush future of shade and flycatchers
maintaining the relationship between mosquitoes and moisture. No toxins; no anti-growth.
Our night-lights out here stick out sharp—sore thumb exposure, a failure of perspective
of what is lured to the hot light. Mouth dry. We go away too and bring places
back in descriptions but we won’t let them set root—they grow inside and reach
no light, this bright light that weakens accustoming eyes over time, straining
to pick out moss from lichen, which shields the granite boulders it breaks down.
Gradient cuts underfoot the echidna following termite galleries, interstices
of plumbed surface-sounds. We go back to the records, the old books, which are young
and would replace those earlier cuckoo sounds, the kickings-out in nests, the breaking
through of secret chambers—all here, too, like birth, but with an unanswered history,
or partially echoed and not fully addressed. This stuff we do with our souls to adjust
the fragments of bush to whose maps? To miss the kangaroo trail though it’s before our eyes,
or the path of an elusive rain, or a lake whose existence you might request, hint at, question?
Diverse as the air after war is gone but we still can’t breathe so something slips
or grafts. The stain. We rely on such conservancy, on gestures of repair and renewal
that regenerate, to sustain with hands-off learning to let be, to live alongside,
harvest no more than needs be. Such need manifests. Such sleep of passing
is the caveat, is the covenant is the testament of work that rains without a cloud in the sky.
Memorandum of walk of planting of tending: crowbar to break soil or soft cell, either way.
Mostly, people search for pathways to exemptions
so they can cut down protected trees. Mostly, people
search for ways to get around those thin laws so they
can bring down an old system of life. But here, too, we
want to keep the trees going against the trend of felling,
to give breath to those who stifle the art of growth.
Pollination with the grain to grow canopy
and mark place in shades of green—dry here to reflect
from fool’s gold but grow gnarled out of off-red dirt we coax with seedlings
if rain sets green-inflected light you nurtured far from here, far where necessities
work outside the poem for each better-suited frond of palm frond, a eucalypt trunk,
any particular roots. Dry wet dry. Making growth to suit a soil’s recovery.

For Steve



                         Remember when we almost drowned in ’03, the woods
            so thick we only knew the rainstorm by sound of thunder
and violence of the creek, how every day I’d take you to the Stop-N-Go
                         for your case of Natty Lights? Think back to summertime,
            when after lunch you’d pull your shirt off and wring it in your hands
and count off one beer, wring some more, two beers, how in July you’d sweat
                         all the way through last night’s binge. Think back to when
            we chopped paths across hardwood bottoms for skidders to plow
makeshift roads for Justiss Oil pumpjacks to suck black snot the earth
                         doesn’t blow. I wanted to call in sick every day, to feel
            the sunrise through my bedroom pane instead of the company truck’s
windshield. But this isn’t about that. What was I? Eighteen? Drinking
                         creamy coffee the color of soupy dishwater, the callouses
            of my hands sanding the white Styrofoam cup, whiskey from a flask
stirred into yours. I grew to welcome the start of a day filing blades, the rhythm
                         I’d find scraping down, down, up and over. I didn’t care
            like you did for squaring drill sites with double-knots of orange flagging
for the loggers, how we kneeled, panting in the dirt, how you would pan your head
                          to take inventory of the beech and white oaks rooted inside
            the flagged-off square. I don’t know what it mattered, Steve,
which tree we marked for loggers to fell, which sapling we ourselves chopped
                         with machetes. Did the thicket not return what we gave?
            Did the thorn limbs and briars not cut your flesh into estuaries
of brackish pink creeks of sweat and blood? Nothing changes much,
                         does it, Steve? I’m filing a brush hook’s edge for the first time
            in years and still hear you yelling at me, Not like that, Smith. Just give

They scatter: a crater of half-chewed leaves,

thundering from behind the scruffy bush.
They coagulate like veins galloping from his heart

until they twist abruptly, sideways, their necks
barely whisking the nick of his fangs and claw.
Changing tempo and direction, their hooves are staccato
music driving him to exhaustion. They pronk.

       Thus, weary of life, in view of the great consummation which awaits us — tomorrow, we rush among our friends congratulating ourselves upon the joy soon to be. Thoughtless of evil we crush out the marrow of those about us with our heavy cars as we go happily from place to place. It seems that there is not time enough in which to speak the full of our exaltation. Only a day is left, one miserable day, before the world comes into its own. Let us hurry ! Why bother for this man or that ? In the offices of the great newspapers a mad joy reigns as they prepare the final extras. Rushing about, men bump each other into the whirring presses. How funny it seems. All thought of misery has left us. Why should we care ? Children laughingly fling themselves under the wheels of the street cars, airplanes crash gaily to the earth. Someone has written a poem.
 
       Oh life, bizarre fowl, what color are your wings ? Green, blue, red, yellow, purple, white, brown, orange, black, grey ? In the imagination, flying above the wreck of ten thousand million souls, I see you departing sadly for the land of plants and insects, already far out to sea. (Thank you, I know well what I am plagiarising) Your great wings flap as you disappear in the distance over the pre-Columbian acres of floating weed.

Would you like to throw a stone at me?
Here, take all that’s left of my peach.
 
Blood-red, deep:
Heaven knows how it came to pass.
Somebody’s pound of flesh rendered up.
 
Wrinkled with secrets
And hard with the intention to keep them.
 
Why, from silvery peach-bloom,
From that shallow-silvery wine-glass on a short stem
This rolling, dropping, heavy globule?
 
I am thinking, of course, of the peach before I ate it.
 
Why so velvety, why so voluptuous heavy?
Why hanging with such inordinate weight?
Why so indented?
 
Why the groove?
Why the lovely, bivalve roundnesses?
Why the ripple down the sphere?
Why the suggestion of incision?
 
Why was not my peach round and finished like a billiard ball?
It would have been if man had made it.
Though I’ve eaten it now.
 
But it wasn’t round and finished like a billiard ball;
And because I say so, you would like to throw something at me.

I love you, rotten,
Delicious rottenness.
 
I love to suck you out from your skins
So brown and soft and coming suave,
So morbid, as the Italians say.
 
What a rare, powerful, reminiscent flavour
Comes out of your falling through the stages of decay:
Stream within stream.
 
Something of the same flavour as Syracusan muscat wine
Or vulgar Marsala.
 
Though even the word Marsala will smack of preciosity
Soon in the pussy-foot West.
 
What is it?
What is it, in the grape turning raisin,
In the medlar, in the sorb-apple,
Wineskins of brown morbidity,
Autumnal excrementa;
What is it that reminds us of white gods?
 
Gods nude as blanched nut-kernels,
Strangely, half-sinisterly flesh-fragrant
As if with sweat,
And drenched with mystery.
 
Sorb-apples, medlars with dead crowns.
I say, wonderful are the hellish experiences,
Orphic, delicate
Dionysos of the Underworld.
 
A kiss, and a vivid spasm of farewell, a moment’s orgasm of rupture,
Then along the damp road alone, till the next turning.
And there, a new partner, a new parting, a new unfusing into twain,
A new gasp of further isolation,
A new intoxication of loneliness, among decaying, frost-cold leaves.
 
Going down the strange lanes of hell, more and more intensely alone,
The fibres of the heart parting one after the other
And yet the soul continuing, naked-footed, ever more vividly embodied
Like a flame blown whiter and whiter
In a deeper and deeper darkness,
Ever more exquisite, distilled in separation.
 
So, in the strange retorts of medlars and sorb-apples
The distilled essence of hell.
The exquisite odour of leave-taking. Jamque vale!
Orpheus, and the winding, leaf-clogged, silent lanes of hell.
 
Each soul departing with its own isolation.
Strangest of all strange companions,
And best.
 
Medlars, sorb-apples
More than sweet
Flux of autumn
Sucked out of your empty bladders
And sipped down, perhaps, with a sip of Marsala
So that the rambling, sky-dropped grape can add its music to yours,
Orphic farewell, and farewell, and farewell
And the ego sum of Dionysos
The sono io of perfect drunkenness
Intoxication of final loneliness.

She thought she had left him;
But opened around her purple anemones,
Caverns,
Little hells of color, caves of darkness,
Hell, risen in pursuit of her; royal, sumptuous
Pit-falls.
 
All at her feet
Hell opening;
At her white ankles
Hell rearing its husband-splendid, serpent heads,
Hell-purple, to get at her—Why did he let her go?
So he could track her down again, white victim.

Out on earth again.

No more stockings to darn for the flower-roots, down in hell?
But ah my dear!
 
Aha, the stripe-cheeked whelps, whippet-slim crocuses,At ’em, boys, at ’em!Ho golden-spaniel, sweet alert narcissus,Smell ’em, smell ’em out!

Somebody is coming!Oho there!
 
Dark blue anemones!
Hell is up!
Hell on earth, and Dis within the depths!
 Run, Persephone, he is after you already.
 Why did he let her go?
To track her down;
All the sport of summer and spring, and flowers snapping
               at her ankles and catching her by the hair!

When he pushed his bush of black hair off his brow:
When she lifted her mop from her eyes, and screwed it
            in a knob behind
            —O act of fearful temerity!
When they felt their foreheads bare, naked to heaven,
            their eyes revealed:
When they left the light of heaven brandished like a knife at
            their defenceless eyes
And the sea like a blade at their face,
Mediterranean savages:
When they came out, face-revealed, under heaven, from
            the shaggy undergrowth of their own hair
For the first time,
They saw tiny rose cyclamens between their toes, growing
Where the slow toads sat brooding on the past.
 
Slow toads, and cyclamen leaves
Stickily glistening with eternal shadow
Keeping to earth.
Cyclamen leaves
Toad-filmy, earth-iridescent
Beautiful
Frost-filigreed
Spumed with mud

And man’s defenceless bare face
And cyclamens putting their ears back.
 
Long, pensive, slim-muzzled greyhound buds
Dreamy, not yet present,
Drawn out of earth
At his toes.

Sub-delighted, stone engendered
Cyclamens, young cyclamens
Arching
Waking, pricking their ears
Like delicate very-young greyhound bitches
Half-yawning at the open, inexperienced
Vistas of day,
Folding back their soundless petalled ears.
 
Greyhound bitches
Bending their rosy muzzles pensive down,
And breathing soft, unwilling to wake to the new day
Yet sub-delighted.
 
Ah Mediterranean morning, when our world began!
Far-off Mediterranean mornings,
Pelasgic faces uncovered
And unbudding cyclamens.
 
The hare suddenly goes uphill
Laying back her long ears with unwinking bliss.
 
And up the pallid, sea-blenched Mediterranean stone-slopes
Rose cyclamen, ecstatic fore-runner!
Cyclamens, ruddy-muzzled cyclamens
In little bunches like bunches of wild hares
Muzzles together, ears-aprick
 
Whispering witchcraft
Like women at a well, the dawn-fountain.

While all the Parthenon marbles still fostered the roots of the cyclamen.

                ","
A snake came to my water-trough
On a hot, hot day, and I in pyjamas for the heat,
To drink there.
 
In the deep, strange-scented shade of the great dark carob tree
I came down the steps with my pitcher
And must wait, must stand and wait, for there he was at the trough
            before me.
 
He reached down from a fissure in the earth-wall in the gloom
And trailed his yellow-brown slackness soft-bellied down, over
            the edge of the stone trough
And rested his throat upon the stone bottom,
And where the water had dripped from the tap, in a small clearness,
He sipped with his straight mouth,
Softly drank through his straight gums, into his slack long body,
Silently.
 
Someone was before me at my water-trough,
And I, like a second-comer, waiting.
 
He lifted his head from his drinking, as cattle do,
And looked at me vaguely, as drinking cattle do,
And flickered his two-forked tongue from his lips, and mused
             a moment,
And stooped and drank a little more,
Being earth-brown, earth-golden from the burning bowels
            of the earth
On the day of Sicilian July, with Etna smoking.
 
The voice of my education said to me
He must be killed,
For in Sicily the black, black snakes are innocent, the gold
            are venomous.
 
And voices in me said, If you were a man
You would take a stick and break him now, and finish him off.
 
But must I confess how I liked him,
How glad I was he had come like a guest in quiet, to drink
            at my water-trough
And depart peaceful, pacified, and thankless,
Into the burning bowels of this earth?
 
Was it cowardice, that I dared not kill him?
Was it perversity, that I longed to talk to him?
Was it humility, to feel so honoured?
I felt so honoured.
 
And yet those voices:If you were not afraid, you would kill him!
 
And truly I was afraid, I was most afraid,
But even so, honoured still more
That he should seek my hospitality
From out the dark door of the secret earth.
 
He drank enough
And lifted his head, dreamily, as one who has drunken,
And flickered his tongue like a forked night on the air, so black,
Seeming to lick his lips,
And looked around like a god, unseeing, into the air,
And slowly turned his head,
And slowly, very slowly, as if thrice adream,
Proceeded to draw his slow length curving round
And climb again the broken bank of my wall-face.
 
And as he put his head into that dreadful hole,
And as he slowly drew up, snake-easing his shoulders,
            and entered farther,
A sort of horror, a sort of protest against his withdrawing into
            that horrid black hole,
Deliberately going into the blackness, and slowly drawing
            himself after,
Overcame me now his back was turned.
 
I looked round, I put down my pitcher,
I picked up a clumsy log
And threw it at the water-trough with a clatter.
 
I think it did not hit him,
But suddenly that part of him that was left behind convulsed
            in an undignified haste,
Writhed like lightning, and was gone
Into the black hole, the earth-lipped fissure in the wall-front,
At which, in the intense still noon, I stared with fascination.
 
And immediately I regretted it.
I thought how paltry, how vulgar, what a mean act!
I despised myself and the voices of my accursed human education.
 
And I thought of the albatross,
And I wished he would come back, my snake.
 
For he seemed to me again like a king,
Like a king in exile, uncrowned in the underworld,
Now due to be crowned again.
 
And so, I missed my chance with one of the lords
Of life.
And I have something to expiate:
A pettiness.

but i have seen
death’s clever enormous voice
which hides in a fragility
of poppies. . . .
 
i say that sometimes
on these long talkative animals
are laid fists of huger silence.
 
I have seen all the silence
filled with vivid noiseless boys
 
at Roupy
i have seen
between barrages,
 
the night utter ripe unspeaking girls.

Dearer than words on paper, shall depart,

In a round nimbus, nor a broken dart
Of moonlight, even, splintered on the sea;

And weep somewhat, as now you see me weep—

Fearful of death yet amorous of sleep,
Droops for a moment and beholds, dismayed,
The wind whereon its petals shall be laid.

                    On Pleasure
                ","
Then a hermit, who visited the city once
a year, came forth and said, Speak to us of
Pleasure.
    And he answered, saying:
    Pleasure is a freedom-song,
    But it is not freedom.
    It is the blossoming of your desires,
    But it is not their fruit.
    It is a depth calling unto a height,
    But it is not the deep nor the high.
    It is the caged taking wing,
    But it is not space encompassed.
    Ay, in very truth, pleasure is a freedom-
song.
    And I fain would have you sing it with
fullness of heart; yet I would not have you
lose your hearts in the singing.
 
    Some of your youth seek pleasure as if it
were all, and they are judged and rebuked.
    I would not judge nor rebuke them. I
would have them seek.
    For they shall find pleasure, but not her
alone;
    Seven are her sisters, and the least of them
is more beautiful than pleasure.
    Have you not heard of the man who was
digging in the earth for roots and found a
treasure?
 
    And some of your elders remember
pleasures with regret like wrongs com-
mitted in drunkenness.
    But regret is the beclouding of the mind
 and not its chastisement.
    They should remember their pleasures with
gratitude, as they would the harvest of a
summer.
    Yet if it comforts them to regret, let them
be comforted.
 
    And there are among you those who are
neither young to seek nor old to remember;
    And in their fear of seeking and remem-
bering they shun all pleasures, lest they
neglect the spirit or offend against it.
    But even in their foregoing is their
pleasure.
    And thus they too find a treasure though
they dig for roots with quivering hands.
    But tell me, who is he that can offend the
spirit?
    Shall the nightingale offend the stillness of
the night, or the firefly the stars?
    And shall your flame or your smoke
burden the wind?
    Think you the spirit is a still pool which
you can trouble with a staff?
 
    Oftentimes in denying yourself pleasure
you do but store the desire in the recesses
of your being.
    Who knows but that which seems omitted
today, waits for tomorrow?
    Even your body knows its heritage and
its rightful need and will not be deceived.
    And your body is the harp of your soul,
    And it is yours to bring forth sweet
music from it or confused sounds.
 
     And now you ask in your heart, “How
shall we distinguish that which is good in
pleasure from that which is not good?”
     Go to your fields and your gardens, and
you shall learn that it is the pleasure of
the bee to gather honey of the flower,
     But it is also the pleasure of the flower
to yield its honey to the bee.
     For to the bee a flower is a fountain of
life,
     And to the flower a bee is a messenger of
love,
     And to both, bee and flower, the giving
and the receiving of pleasure is a need and
an ecstasy.

ures like the flowers and the bees.

And a poet said, Speak to us of Beauty.
     And he answered:
     Where shall you seek beauty, and how
shall you find her unless she herself be your
way and your guide?
     And how shall you speak of her except
she be the weaver of your speech?
 
     The aggrieved and the injured say,
“Beauty is kind and gentle.
     Like a young mother half-shy of her
own glory she walks among us.”
     And the passionate say, “Nay, beauty is
a thing of might and dread.
     Like the tempest she shakes the earth
beneath us and the sky above us.”
 
     The tired and the weary say, “Beauty is
of soft whisperings. She speaks in our spirit.
     Her voice yields to our silences like a faint
light that quivers in fear of the shadow.”
     But the restless say, “We have heard her
shouting among the mountains,
     And with her cries came the sound of
hoofs, and the beating of wings and
the roaring of lions.”
 
     At night the watchmen of the city say,
“Beauty shall rise with the dawn from the
east.”
     And at noontide the toilers and the way-
farers say, “We have seen her leaning over
the earth from the windows of the sunset.”
 
     In winter say the snow-bound, “She shall
come with the spring leaping upon the hills.”
     And in the summer heat the reapers say,
“We have seen her dancing with the autumn
leaves, and we saw a drift of snow in her
hair.”
     All these things have you said of beauty,
     Yet in truth you spoke not of her but of
needs unsatisfied,
     And beauty is not a need but an ecstasy.
     It is not a mouth thirsting nor an empty
hand stretched forth,
     But rather a heart enflamed and a soul en-
chanted.
     It is not the image you would see nor the
song you would hear,
     But rather an image you see though you
close your eyes and a song you hear though
you shut your ears.
     It is not the sap within the furrowed bark,
nor a wing attached to a claw,
     But rather a garden for ever in bloom and
a flock of angels for ever in flight.
 
     People of Orphalese, beauty is life when
life unveils her holy face.
     But you are life and you are the veil.
     Beauty is eternity gazing at itself in a mir-
ror.
     But you are eternity and you are the mir-
ror.

laughs with you.
    Verily the ocean laughs always with the
innocent.

ocean, and man-made laws are not sand-
towers,

shadows are their laws.

And an orator said, Speak to us of Free-
dom.

    At the city gate and by your fireside I
have seen you prostrate yourself and worship
your own freedom,
    Even as slaves humble themselves before
a tyrant and praise him though he slays
them.
    Ay, in the grove of the temple and in
the shadow of the citadel I have seen the
freest among you wear their freedom as a
yoke and a handcuff.
    And my heart bled within me; for you
can only be free when even the desire of
seeking freedom becomes a harness to you,
and when you cease to speak of freedom
as a goal and a fulfilment.
 
    You shall be free indeed when your days
are not without a care nor your nights with-
out a want and a grief,
    But rather when these things girdle your
life and yet you rise above them naked and
unbound.
 
    And how shall you rise beyond your
days and nights unless you break the chains
which you at the dawn of your under-
standing have fastened around your noon
hour?
    In truth that which you call freedom is
the strongest of these chains, though its
links glitter in the sun and dazzle your eyes.
 
    And what is it but fragments of your own
self you would discard that you may become
free?
    If it is an unjust law you would abolish,
that law was written with your own hand
upon your own forehead.
    You cannot erase it by burning your law
 books nor by washing the foreheads of your
judges, though you pour the sea upon them.
    And if it is a despot you would dethrone,
see first that his throne erected within you is
destroyed.
    For how can a tyrant rule the free and
the proud, but for a tyranny in their own
freedom and a shame in their own pride?
    And if it is a care you would cast off, that
care has been chosen by you rather than
imposed upon you.
    And if it is a fear you would dispel, the
seat of that fear is in your heart and not in
the hand of the feared.
 
    Verily all things move within your being
in constant half embrace, the desired and
the dreaded, the repugnant and the cherished,
the pursued and that which you would
escape.
    These things move within you as lights
and shadows in pairs that cling.
    And when the shadow fades and is no
more, the light that lingers becomes a
shadow to another light.
    And thus your freedom when it loses its
fetters becomes itself the fetter of a greater
freedom.

gifts also.

frankincense, and that which they bring,
though fashioned of dreams, is raiment
 and food for your soul.

empty hands.

     So shall he descend to your roots and
shake them in their clinging to the earth.
                                       •
     Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto
himself.
     He threshes you to make you naked.
     He sifts you to free you from your husks.
     He grinds you to whiteness.
     He kneads you until you are pliant;
     And then he assigns you to his sacred
fire, that you may become sacred bread for
God’s sacred feast.
 
     All these things shall love do unto you
that you may know the secrets of your
heart, and in that knowledge become a
fragment of Life’s heart.
 
     But if in your fear you would seek only
love’s peace and love’s pleasure,
     Then it is better for you that you cover
your nakedness and pass out of love’s
threshing-floor,
     Into the seasonless world where you
shall laugh, but not all of your laughter,
and weep, but not all of your tears.
                                      •
     Love gives naught but itself and takes
naught but from itself.
     Love possesses not nor would it be
possessed;
     For love is sufficient unto love.
 
     When you love you should not say,
“God is in my heart,” but rather, “I am
in the heart of God.”
     And think not you can direct the course
of love, for love, if it finds you worthy,
directs your course.
 
     Love has no other desire but to fulfil
itself.
     But if you love and must needs have
desires, let these be your desires:
     To melt and be like a running brook
that sings its melody to the night.
     To know the pain of too much tenderness.
     To be wounded by your own under-
standing of love;
     And to bleed willingly and joyfully.
     To wake at dawn with a winged heart
and give thanks for another day of loving;
     To rest at the noon hour and meditate
love’s ecstasy;
     To return home at eventide with grati-
tude;
     And then to sleep with a prayer for the
beloved in your heart and a song of praise
upon your lips.

                ","
I came an errand one cloud-blowing evening
To a slab-built, black-paper-covered house
Of one room and one window and one door,
The only dwelling in a waste cut over
A hundred square miles round it in the mountains:
And that not dwelt in now by men or women.
(It never had been dwelt in, though, by women,
So what is this I make a sorrow of?)
I came as census-taker to the waste
To count the people in it and found none,
None in the hundred miles, none in the house,
Where I came last with some hope, but not much,
After hours’ overlooking from the cliffs
An emptiness flayed to the very stone.
I found no people that dared show themselves,
None not in hiding from the outward eye.
The time was autumn, but how anyone
Could tell the time of year when every tree
That could have dropped a leaf was down itself
And nothing but the stump of it was left
Now bringing out its rings in sugar of pitch;
And every tree up stood a rotting trunk
Without a single leaf to spend on autumn,
Or branch to whistle after what was spent.
Perhaps the wind the more without the help
Of breathing trees said something of the time
Of year or day the way it swung a door
Forever off the latch, as if rude men
Passed in and slammed it shut each one behind him
For the next one to open for himself.
I counted nine I had no right to count
(But this was dreamy unofficial counting)
Before I made the tenth across the threshold.
Where was my supper? Where was anyone’s?
No lamp was lit. Nothing was on the table.
The stove was cold—the stove was off the chimney—
And down by one side where it lacked a leg.
The people that had loudly passed the door
Were people to the ear but not the eye.
They were not on the table with their elbows.
They were not sleeping in the shelves of bunks.
I saw no men there and no bones of men there.
I armed myself against such bones as might be
With the pitch-blackened stub of an ax-handle
I picked up off the straw-dust covered floor.
Not bones, but the ill-fitted window rattled.
The door was still because I held it shut
While I thought what to do that could be done—
About the house—about the people not there.
This house in one year fallen to decay
Filled me with no less sorrow than the houses
Fallen to ruin in ten thousand years
Where Asia wedges Africa from Europe.
Nothing was left to do that I could see
Unless to find that there was no one there
And declare to the cliffs too far for echo,
“The place is desert, and let whoso lurks
In silence, if in this he is aggrieved,
Break silence now or be forever silent.
Let him say why it should not be declared so.”
The melancholy of having to count souls
Where they grow fewer and fewer every year
Is extreme where they shrink to none at all.
It must be I want life to go on living.

In here and there a bird, or butterfly,

Though some savants make earth include the sky;
And blue so far above us comes so high,

Tomorrow dead will come to stay.’
 
So sure of death the marbles rhyme,
Yet can’t help marking all the time

Once when the snow of the year was beginning to fall,
We stopped by a mountain pasture to say, ‘Whose colt?’
A little Morgan had one forefoot on the wall,
The other curled at his breast. He dipped his head
And snorted at us. And then he had to bolt.
We heard the miniature thunder where he fled,
And we saw him, or thought we saw him, dim and grey,
Like a shadow against the curtain of falling flakes.
‘I think the little fellow’s afraid of the snow.
He isn’t winter-broken. It isn’t play
With the little fellow at all. He’s running away.
I doubt if even his mother could tell him, “Sakes,
It’s only weather.” He’d think she didn’t know!
Where is his mother? He can’t be out alone.’
And now he comes again with a clatter of stone
And mounts the wall again with whited eyes
And all his tail that isn't hair up straight.
He shudders his coat as if to throw off flies.
‘Whoever it is that leaves him out so late,
When other creatures have gone to stall and bin,
Ought to be told to come and take him in.’

To drum on the floor with scurrying hoofs

Their murmur more like the sigh we sigh
From too much dwelling on what has been.

Dreamer of purified fury and fabulous habit,
your eyes of deserted white afternoons
target, stiffen, riot with unicorn candor
so I swallow your body like meanings or whisky or as you swallow me.
 
Break rhythm here:      your kiss is my justice:
look then now how orange blooms of jubilation unfold in satisfied air!
This sex is more than sex, under the will of the God of sex,
so I softly invoke transformation of your rueful image of haven
–those frozen rocks, that guilty lighthouse isolate from temptation–
to warm Flemish landscape green and brighteyed with daisies of
     dizzying color
where pilgrims are dancing after gospelling bird who sing of
      new springs, good water.

                ","
 I came here, being stricken, stumbling out
At last from streets; the sun, decreasing, took me
For days, the time being the last of autumn,
The thickets not yet stark, but quivering
With tiny colors, like some brush strokes in
The manner of the pointillists; small yellows
Dart shaped, little reds in different pattern,
Clicks and notches of color on threaded bushes,
A cracked and fluent heaven, and a brown earth.
I had these, and my food and sleep—enough.
 
This is a countryside of roofless houses,—
Taverns to rain,—doorsteps of millstones, lintels
Leaning and delicate, foundations sprung to lilacs.
Orchards where boughs like roots strike into the sky.
Here I could well devise the journey to nothing,
At night getting down from the wagon by the black barns,
The zenith a point of darkness, breaking to bits,
Showering motionless stars over the houses.
Scenes relentless—the black and white grooves of a woodcut.
 
But why the journey to nothing or any desire?
Why the heart taken by even senseless adventure,
The goal a coffer of dust?    Give my mouth to the air,
Let arrogant pain lick my flesh with a tongue
Rough as a cat’s; remember the smell of cold mornings,
The dried beauty of women, the exquisite skin
Under the chins of young girls, young men’s rough beards,—
The cringing promise of this one, that one’s apology
For the knife struck down to the bone, gladioli in sick rooms,
Asters and dahlias, flowers like ruches, rosettes. . .
 
Forever enough to part grass over the stones
By some brook or well, the lovely seed-shedding stalks;
To hear in the single wind diverse branches
Repeating their sounds to the sky—that sky like scaled mackerel,
Fleeing the fields—to be defended from silence,
To feel my body as arid, as safe as a twig
Broken away from whatever growth could snare it
Up to a spring, or hold it softly in summer
Or beat it under in snow.
 
                                                       I must get well.
Walk on strong legs, leap the hurdles of sense,  
Reason again, come back to my old patchwork logic,
Addition, subtraction, money, clothes, clocks,
Memories (freesias, smelling slightly of snow and of flesh
In a room with blue curtains) ambition, despair.
I must feel again who had given feeling over,
Challenge laughter, take tears, play the piano,
Form judgments, blame a crude world for disaster.
 
To escape is nothing.    Not to escape is nothing.
The farmer’s wife stands with a halo of darkness
Rounding her head.    Water drips in the kitchen
Tapping the sink.    To-day the maples have split
Limb from the trunk with the ice, a fresh wooden wound.
The vines are distorted with ice, ice burdens the breaking
Roofs I have told you of.

I have watched your eyes, cleansed from regret,
And your lips, closed over all that love cannot say,

Nothing was remembered, nothing forgotten.
When we awoke, wagons were passing on the warm summer   
          pavements,
The window-sills were wet from rain in the night,
Birds scattered and settled over chimneypots
As among grotesque trees.
 
Nothing was accepted, nothing looked beyond.
Slight-voiced bells separated hour from hour,
The afternoon sifted coolness
And people drew together in streets becoming deserted.
There was a moon, and light in a shop-front,
And dusk falling like precipitous water.
 
Hand clasped hand
Forehead still bowed to forehead—
Nothing was lost, nothing possessed
There was no gift nor denial.
 
2.
I have remembered you.
You were not the town visited once,
Nor the road falling behind running feet.
 
You were as awkward as flesh
And lighter than frost or ashes.
 
You were the rind,
And the white-juiced apple,
The song, and the words waiting for music.
 
3.
You have learned the beginning;
Go from mine to the other.
 
Be together; eat, dance, despair,
Sleep, be threatened, endure.
You will know the way of that.
 
But at the end, be insolent;
Be absurd—strike the thing short off;
Be mad—only do not let talk
Wear the bloom from silence.
 
And go away without fire or lantern
Let there be some uncertainty about your departure.

You may have all things from me, save my breath,
The slight life in my throat will not give pause
For your love, nor your loss, nor any cause.
Shall I be made a panderer to death,
Dig the green ground for darkness underneath,
Let the dust serve me, covering all that was
With all that will be? Better, from time’s claws,
The hardened face under the subtle wreath.
 
Cooler than stones in wells, sweeter, more kind
Than hot, perfidious words, my breathing moves
Close to my plunging blood.    Be strong, and hang
Unriven mist over my breast and mind,
My breath! We shall forget the heart that loves,
Though in my body beat its blade, and its fang.

I erred, when I thought loneliness the wide
Scent of mown grass over forsaken fields,
Or any shadow isolation yields.
Loneliness was the heart within your side.
Your thought, beyond my touch, was tilted air
Ringed with as many borders as the wind.
How could I judge you gentle or unkind
When all bright flying space was in your care?
 
Now that I leave you, I shall be made lonely
By simple empty days, never that chill
Resonant heart to strike between my arms
Again, as though distraught for distance,­–only
Levels of evening, now, behind a hill,
Or a late cock-crow from the darkening farms.

And tears were found too dreadful not to last.
 
Here stood the seats of judgment and its light,

          Our best and worst, our Paradise and Hell;

Before Man’s labouring wisdom gave me birth
I had not even seen the light of day;
Down in the central darkness of the earth,
Crushed by the weight of continents I lay,
Ground by the weight to heat, not knowing then
The air, the light, the noise, the world of men.

We grew on mountains where the glaciers cry,
Infinite sombre armies of us stood
Below the snow-peaks which defy the sky;
A song like the gods moaning filled our wood;
We knew no men—our life was to stand staunch,
Singing our song, against the avalanche.

We were a million grasses on the hill,
A million herbs which bowed as the wind blew,
Trembling in every fibre, never still;
Out of the summer earth sweet life we drew.
Little blue-flowered grasses up the glen,
Glad of the sun, what did we know of men?

We tore the iron from the mountain’s hold,
By blasting fires we smithied it to steel;
Out of the shapeless stone we learned to mould
The sweeping bow, the rectilinear keel;
We hewed the pine to plank, we split the fir,
We pulled the myriad flax to fashion her.
 
Out of a million lives our knowledge came,
A million subtle craftsmen forged the means;
Steam was our handmaid and our servant flame,
Water our strength, all bowed to our machines.
Out of the rock, the tree, the springing herb
We built this wandering beauty so superb.
  
                                 THE SAILORS
 
We, who were born on earth and live by air,

The speechless sea; alone we commune there
Jesting with death, that ever open door.
Sun, moon and stars are signs by which we drive
This wind-blown iron like a thing alive.

Over the uncruddled billows of seas green
I blanch the bubbled highway of my wake.
By me my wandering tenants clasp the hands,
And know the thoughts of men in other lands.

As unto lighter strains a boy might turn
     From where great altars burn
And Music’s grave archangels tread the night,
          So I, in seasons past,
          Loved not the bitter might
          And merciless control
Of thy bleak trumpets calling to the soul.
          Their consummating blast
     Held inspirations of affright,
               As when a faun
          Hears mournful thunders roll
On breathless, wide transparencies of dawn.
               Nor would I hear
          With thee, superb and clear
The indomitable laughter of the race;
               Nor would I face
Clean Truth, with her cold agates of the well,
               Nor with thee trace
Her footprints passing upward to the snows,
          But sought a phantom rose
And islands where the ghostly siren sings;
               Nor would I dwell
          Where star-forsaking wings
On mortal thresholds hide their mystery,
                    Nor watch with thee
The light of Heaven cast on common things.
 
But now in dreams of day I see thee stand
A grey, great sentry on the encompassed wall
That fronts the Night forever, in thy hand
               A consecrated spear
To test the dragons of man's ancient fear
               From secret gulfs that crawl—
          A captain of that choral band
Whose reverend faces, anxious of the Dark,
                    Yet undismayed
By rain of ruined worlds against the night,
               Turned evermore to hark
The music of God's silence, and were stayed
By something other than the reason’s light.
               And I have seen thee as
               An eagle, strong to pass
Where tempest-shapen clouds go to and fro
               And winds and noons have birth,
But whose regard is on the lands below
               And wingless things of earth.
               And yet not thine for long
The feignéd passion of the nightingale,
Nor shards of haliotis, nor the song
Of cymballed fountains hidden in the dale,
Nor gardens where the feet of Fragrance steal:
     ’Twas thine the laying-on to feel
Of tragic hands imperious and cold,
That grasping, led thee from the dreams of old,
               Making thee voyager
Of seas within the cosmic solitude,
Whose moons the long-familiar stars occlude,—
               Whose living sunsets stir
With visions of the timelessness we crave.

Nature hath lonely voices at her heart
     And some thou heardst, for at thine own
          Were chords beyond all Art
That thrill but to the eternal undertone.
     But not necessitous to thee
The dreams that were when Arcady began
Or Paphos soared in iris from the sea;
                         For thou couldst guess
The rainbows hidden in the frustrate slime,
               And sawst in crownless Man
               A Titan scourged thro’ Time
With pains and raptures of his loneliness.
               And thou wast wanderer
In that dim House that is the human heart,
               Where thou didst roam apart,
               Seeing what pillars were
Between its deep foundations and the sun,
               What halls of dream undone,
What seraphs hold compassionate their wings
Between the youth and bitterness of things,
                    Ere all see clear
The gain in loss, the triumph in the tear.
 
Time’s whitest loves lie radiant in thy song,
Like starlight on an ocean, for thine own
     Was as a deathless lily grown
In Paradise—ethereal and strong.
                         And to thine eyes
Earth had no earth that held not haughty dust,
And seeds of future harvestings in trust,
And hidden azures of eventual skies.
               Yet hadst thou sharper strains,
Even as the Power determines us with pains,
And seeing harvests, sawst as well the chaff,
And seeing Beauty, sawst her shames no less,
                    Loosing the sweet,
     High thunder of thy Jovian laugh
On souls purblind in their self-righteousness.
               O vision wide and keen!
Which knew, untaught, that pains to joyance are
               As night unto the star
That on the effacing dawn must burn unseen.
               And thou didst know what meat
               Was torn to give us milk,
What countless worms made possible the silk
               That robes the mind, what plan
Drew as a bubble from old infamies
               And fen-pools of the past
The shy and many-colored soul of man.
               Yea! thou hast seen the lees
In that rich cup we lift against the day,
Seen the man-child at his disastrous play—
               His shafts without a mark,
His fountains flowing downward to the dark,
               His maiming and his bars,
                    Then turned to see
His vatic shadow cast athwart the stars,
And his strange challenge to infinity.
 
               But who am I to speak,
Far down the mountain, of its altar-peak,
               Or cross on feeble wings,
Adventurous, the oceans in thy mind?
We of a wider day’s bewilderings
               For very light seem blind,
And fearful of the gods our hands have formed.
               Some lift their eyes and seem
To see at last the lofty human scheme
Fading and topping as a sunset stormed
By wind and evening, with the stars in doubt.
And some cry, “On to Brotherhood!” And some
                (Their Dream's high music dumb):“Nay! let us hide in roses all our chains,               Tho’ all the lamps go out!               Let us accept our lords! Time’s tensions move not save to subtler pains.” 
And over all the Silence is as swords. …
Wherefore be near us in our day of choice,
               Lest Hell’s red choirs rejoice;
               And may our counsels be
More wise, more kindly, for the thought of thee;
               And may our deeds attest
               Thy covenant of fame
To men of after-years that see thy name
Held like a flower by Honor to her breast.
Thy station in our hearts long since was won—
              Safe from the jealous years—
Thou of whose love, thou of whose thews and tears
We rest most certain when the day is done 
And formless shadows close upon the sun! 
Thou wast a star ere death’s long night shut down,
               And for thy brows the crown
Was graven ere the birth-pangs, and thy bed 
Is now of hallowed marble, and a fane 
               Among the mightier dead: 
More blameless than thine own what soul hath stood? 
Dost thou lie deaf until another Reign, 
               Or hear as music o’er thy head
The ceaseless trumpets of the war for Good?
                    Ah, thou! ah, thou!
               Stills God thy question now?

I saw the racer coming to the jump,
     Staring with fiery eyeballs as he rusht,
I heard the blood within his body thump,
     I saw him launch, I heard the toppings crusht.
And as he landed I beheld his soul
     Kindle, because, in front, he saw the Straight
With all its thousands roaring at the goal,
     He laughed, he took the moment for his mate.
Would that the passionate moods on which we ride
     Might kindle thus to oneness with the will;
Would we might see the end to which we stride,
     And feel, not strain in struggle, only thrill,
And laugh like him and know in all our nerves
Beauty, the spirit, scattering dust and turves.

                ","
Here, in this darkened room of this old house,
     I sit beside the fire.     I hear again,
Within, the scutter where the mice carouse,
     Without, the gutter dropping with the rain.
Opposite, are black shelves of wormy books,
     To left, glazed cases, dusty with the same,
Behind, a wall, with rusty guns on hooks,
     To right, the fire, that chokes one panting flame.
Over the mantel, black as funeral cloth,
     A portrait hangs, a man, whose flesh the worm
Has mawed this hundred years, whose clothes the moth
     A century since, has channelled to a term.
I cannot see his face :  I only know
He stares at me, that man of long ago.
 
I light the candles in the long brass sticks,
     I see him now, a pale-eyed, simpering man,
Framed in carved wood, wherein the death-watch ticks,
     A most dead face :  yet when the work began
That face, the pale puce coat, the simpering smile,
     The hands that hold a book, the eyes that gaze,
Moved to the touch of mind a little while.
     The painter sat in judgment on his ways :
The painter turned him to and from the light,
     Talked about art, or bade him lift his head.
Judged the lips’ paleness and the temples’ white,
     And now his work abides ;  the man is dead.
But is he dead ?  This dusty study drear
Creaks in its panels that the man is here.
 
Here, beyond doubt, he lived, in that old day.
     “He was a Doctor here,” the student thought.
Here, when the puce was new, that now is grey,
     That simpering man his daily practice wrought.
Here he let blood, prescribed the pill and drop,
     The leech, the diet ;  here his verdict given
Brought agonies of hoping to a stop,
     Here his condemned confessioners were shriven.
What is that book he holds, the key, too dim
     To read, to know ;  some little book he wrote,
Forgotten now, but still the key to him.
     He sacrificed his vision for his coat.
I see the man ;  a simpering mask that hid
A seeing mind that simpering men forbid.
 
Those are his books no doubt, untoucht, undusted,
     Unread, since last he left them on the shelves,
Octavo sermons that the fox has rusted,
     Sides splitting off from brown decaying twelves.
This was his room, this darkness of old death,
     This coffin-room with lights like embrasures,
The place is poisonous with him ;  like a breath
     On glass, he stains the spirit ;  he endures.
Here is his name within the sermon book,
     And verse, “When hungry Worms my Body eat” ;
He leans across my shoulder as I look,
     He who is God or pasture to the wheat.
He who is Dead is still upon the soul
     A check, an inhibition, a control.
 
I draw the bolts.     I am alone within.
     The moonlight through the coloured glass comes faint,
Mottling the passage wall like human skin,
     Pale with the breathings left of withered paint.
But others walk the empty house with me,
     There is no loneliness within these walls
No more than there is stillness in the sea
     Or silence in the eternal waterfalls.
There in the room, to right, they sit at feast ;
     The dropping grey-beard with the cold blue eye,
The lad, his son, that should have been a priest,
     And he, the rake, who made his mother die.
And he, the gambling man, who staked the throw,
They look me through, they follow when I go.
 
They follow with still footing down the hall,
     I know their souls, those fellow-tenants mine,
Their shadows dim those colours on the wall,
     They point my every gesture with a sign.
That grey-beard cast his aged servant forth
     After his forty years of service done,
The gambler supped up riches as the north
     Sups with his death the glories of the sun.
The lad betrayed his trust ;  the rake was he
     Who broke two women’s hearts to ease his own :
They nudge each other as they look at me,
     Shadows, all our, and yet as hard as stone.
And there, he comes, that simpering man, who sold
His mind for coat of puce and penny gold.
 
O ruinous house, within whose corridors
     None but the wicked and the mad go free.
(On the dark stairs they wait, behind the doors
     They crouch, they watch, or creep to follow me.)
Deep in old blood your ominous bricks are red,
     Firm in old bones your walls’ foundations stand,
With dead men’s passions built upon the dead,
     With broken hearts for lime and oaths for sand.
Terrible house, whose horror I have built,
     Sin after sin, unseen, as sand that slips
Telling the time, till now the heaped guilt
     Cries, and the planets circle to eclipse.
You only are the Daunter, you alone
Clutch, till I feel your ivy on the bone.

                ","
Before the unseen cock had called the time,
     Those workers left their beds and stumbled out
Into the street, where dust lay white as lime
     Under the last star that keeps bats about.
Then blinking still from bed, they trod the street,
     The doors closed up and down ;  the traveller heard
Doors opened, closed, then silence, then men’s feet
     Moving to toil, the men too drowsed for word.
The bean-field was a greyness as they passed,
     The darkness of the hedge was starred with flowers,
The moth, with wings like dead leaves, sucked his last,
     The triumphing cock cried out with all his powers ;
His fire of crying made the twilight quick,
Then clink, clink, clink, men’s trowels tapped the brick.
 
I saw the delicate man who built the tower
     Look from the turret at the ground below,
The granite column wavered like a flower,
     But stood in air whatever winds might blow.
Its roots were in the rock, its head stood proud,
     No earthly forest reared a head so high ;
Sometimes the eagle came there, sometimes cloud,
     It was man’s ultimate footstep to the sky.
And in that peak the builder kept his treasure,
     Books with the symbols of his art, the signs
Of knowledge in excitement, skill in pleasure,
     The edge that cut, the rule that kept the lines.
He who had seen his tower beneath the grass,
Rock in the earth, now smiled, because it was.
 
How many thousand men had done his will,  
     Men who had hands, or arms, or strength to spend,
Or cunning with machines, or art, or skill !
     All had obeyed him, working to this end.      
Hundreds in distant lands had given their share
     Of power, to deck it ;  on its every stone
Their oddity of pleasure was laid bare,
     Yet was the tower his offspring, his alone.
His inner eye had seen, his will had made it,
     All the opposing army of men’s minds
Had bowed, had turned, had striven as he bade it,
     Each to his purpose in their myriad kinds.
Now it was done, and in the peak he stood
Seeing his work, and smiled to find it good.
 
It had been stone, earth’s body, hidden deep,
     Lightless and shapeless, where it cooled and hardened.
Now it was as the banner on man’s keep
     Or as the Apple in Eden where God gardened.
Lilies of stone ran round it, and like fires
     The tongues of crockets shot from it and paused,
Horsemen who raced were carven on’t, the spires
     Were bright with gold ;  all this the builder caused.
And standing there, it seemed that all the hive
     Of human skill which now it had become,
Was stone no more, nor building, but alive,
     Trying to speak, this tower that was dumb,
 Trying to speak, nay, speaking, soul to soul
With powers who are, to raven or control

                    About Suffering
                ","
Part of suffering is the useless urge to announce that you’re suffering.
 
There is no other way to say it: I’m suffering. Just to say “I suffer”
helps.
 
I read somewhere, “we become lyrical when we suffer.”
 
Happiness is suffering for the right reasons.
 
First-order suffering is second-order happiness.
 
You have to suffer for beauty? Because you have to suffer.
 
We pride ourselves on a high quality of suffering.
 
Turgenev was born in 1818 in the Province of Orel, and suffered
during his childhood from a tyrannical mother.
 
In the past their suffering was less absurd.
 
The problem is, everything’s worse. Like, paper or plastic? We’re all
still going to die suffering.
 
I value being alone with my thoughts, but it’s weird to say, “This
thing that makes us suffer less, we have to stop doing it.”
 
Isn’t it kind of the point of culture to assuage our feeling needless
and alone?
 
How does one suffer “gladly,” exactly?
 
At least the rich get to suffer in comfort.
 
It makes the life feel longer. Live to suffer another day.
 
One’s past suffering can be a great source of comfort. A torturous
luxury. Velvet upholstery.
 
Suffering is happiness, after forty minutes of desolate shuffling. The
point is, life is suffering.
 
About suffering, no one is ever wrong.

spooned food into his mouth
the camera held it, stayed it

First day of February,
and in the far corner of the yard
the Adirondack chair,
blown over by the wind at Christmas,
is still on its back,
the snow too deep for me
to traipse out and right it,
the ice too sheer
to risk slamming these old bones
to the ground.
In a hospital bed in her room
where her bed used to be,
and her husband,
my Aunt Millie keeps reaching up
for the far corner of the room,
whispering That is so interesting.I will go now.
In April
I will walk out
across the warming grass,
and right the chair
as if there had never been anything
to stop me in the first place,
listening for the buzz of hummingbirds
which reminds me of how fast
things are capable of moving.

The storm was headed in our direction—
big loom of gray like the absolute West
leaned over us. Reports of damage
in the neighboring counties—a silo unfurled
and took wing, a house trailer
twisted loose. On the Doppler screen
the storm looked alive, yellow and green
at the fringes, with a fierce red heart
trending to violet. Sirens swept over
to scare it away, like songbirds
grow strident, circle and bluff
at the sight of an owl.
When the rain came in sheets,
I regretted my sins. When lightning
cracked the red pine's half-rotted heart,
I wished the world more joy
in general. When the worst was over
and the grass lay flat, but alive,
and the sky was a waning bruise,
I thought of that silo, how it wasn't mine,
and all that grain cast back into the world's
wind, maybe some of it still flying.

this kisses they take a slow blues walk
back to me
in the palm of my hand
they spread out/ scratch kick curse & punch

Timing them, you faked and cut

tagged you it put you down, pinned
by the whiteness floating

Could anyone make it through those days
untouched? You waited for

Later, let the sky darken suddenly
and we'd be sent out to empty the lines.

All my life I’ve asked my master
Why I am unable to choose
This sweet man or fancy shoes
Over this stranger, more difficult lover
And these expensive but practical loafers
And why I am unable to author
A book exhibiting my full potential
And have focused instead on inconsequential
Letters to strange and difficult lovers
Who by my letters were never changed.
I certainly haven’t been constrained
By terrible parents or trauma or poverty
And even if I had it wouldn’t explain
My propensity for misery
Anymore than it would my
Propensity for joy.
Maybe I’m just a procrastinator
As life is a procrastination of death
And each breath just a procrastination of breath
And friends a procrastination of work
And work a procrastination of love
And love a procrastination I’m just not above.

We never pressed our cheeks against cold stone

there were three doors in the house and at each door they must
forfeit one of these gifts, and how the real story always begins

beheaded plastic dragons and bunches
 
of black, half-eaten bananas; it was where
her sketchbooks tarried among
abandoned coffee cups and
 
science projects. She meant to go places
in it: camp in its back seat
and cook on its stove while
 
painting the coast of Nova Scotia,
or capturing the cold beauty of the Blue Ridge
mountains at dawn. Instead, she waited
behind its wheel while we scraped violins,
 
made digestive sounds
with trumpets, danced badly at recitals

with unsteady cameras. Sometimes, now,
I look out a window and believe I see it,
see her, waiting for me beside a curb,

clear off a seat, look at the drawing in her lap,
which she began, but never seemed to finish.

I am the only one without a dog.
So, a witness to an ancient symbiosis,
as it's evolved within a modern city:
 
The dogs, I note, are smaller, the owners
less ferocious. The former sniff then poop,
the latter, like potty-training parents, pat their heads,
gather it in plastic doggy-bags.
 
It's no longer for the hunt or for protection;
both species have adapted to survive
hard loneliness inside a small apartment.

It is lost, hiding somewhere out back

holding the shadow of its life

How am I to go on?
I wake up a hundred times a day.
Who am I waiting for
what am I looking for

                                 i         The World without Imagination
Nota: man is the intelligence of his soil,
The sovereign ghost. As such, the Socrates
Of snails, musician of pears, principium
And lex. Sed quaeritur: is this same wig
Of things, this nincompated pedagogue,
Preceptor to the sea? Crispin at sea
Created, in his day, a touch of doubt.
An eye most apt in gelatines and jupes,
Berries of villages, a barber's eye,
An eye of land, of simple salad-beds,
Of honest quilts, the eye of Crispin, hung
On porpoises, instead of apricots,
And on silentious porpoises, whose snouts
Dibbled in waves that were mustachios,
Inscrutable hair in an inscrutable world.
One eats one paté, even of salt, quotha.
It was not so much the lost terrestrial,
The snug hibernal from that sea and salt,
That century of wind in a single puff.
What counted was mythology of self,
Blotched out beyond unblotching. Crispin,
The lutanist of fleas, the knave, the thane,
The ribboned stick, the bellowing breeches, cloak
Of China, cap of Spain, imperative haw
Of hum, inquisitorial botanist,
And general lexicographer of mute
And maidenly greenhorns, now beheld himself,
A skinny sailor peering in the sea-glass.
What word split up in clickering syllables
And storming under multitudinous tones
Was name for this short-shanks in all that brunt?
Crispin was washed away by magnitude.
The whole of life that still remained in him
Dwindled to one sound strumming in his ear,
Ubiquitous concussion, slap and sigh,
Polyphony beyond his baton's thrust.
Could Crispin stem verboseness in the sea,
The old age of a watery realist,
Triton, dissolved in shifting diaphanes
Of blue and green? A wordy, watery age
That whispered to the sun's compassion, made
A convocation, nightly, of the sea-stars,
And on the cropping foot-ways of the moon
Lay grovelling. Triton incomplicate with that
Which made him Triton, nothing left of him,
Except in faint, memorial gesturings,
That were like arms and shoulders in the waves,
Here, something in the rise and fall of wind
That seemed hallucinating horn, and here,
A sunken voice, both of remembering
And of forgetfulness, in alternate strain.
Just so an ancient Crispin was dissolved.
The valet in the tempest was annulled.
Bordeaux to Yucatan, Havana next,
And then to Carolina. Simple jaunt.
Crispin, merest minuscule in the gates,
Dejected his manner to the turbulence.
The salt hung on his spirit like a frost,
The dead brine melted in him like a dew
Of winter, until nothing of himself
Remained, except some starker, barer self
In a starker, barer world, in which the sun
Was not the sun because it never shone
With bland complaisance on pale parasols,
Beetled, in chapels, on the chaste bouquets.
Against his pipping sounds a trumpet cried
Celestial sneering boisterously. Crispin
Became an introspective voyager.
Here was the veritable ding an sich, at last,
Crispin confronting it, a vocable thing,
But with a speech belched out of hoary darks
Noway resembling his, a visible thing,
And excepting negligible Triton, free
From the unavoidable shadow of himself
That lay elsewhere around him. Severance
Was clear. The last distortion of romance
Forsook the insatiable egotist. The sea
Severs not only lands but also selves.
Here was no help before reality.
Crispin beheld and Crispin was made new.
The imagination, here, could not evade,
In poems of plums, the strict austerity
Of one vast, subjugating, final tone.
The drenching of stale lives no more fell down.
What was this gaudy, gusty panoply?
Out of what swift destruction did it spring?
It was caparison of mind and cloud
And something given to make whole among
The ruses that were shattered by the large.
 
                                 iiConcerning the Thunderstorms of Yucatan
In Yucatan, the Maya sonneteers
Of the Caribbean amphitheatre,
In spite of hawk and falcon, green toucan
And jay, still to the night-bird made their plea,
As if raspberry tanagers in palms,
High up in orange air, were barbarous.
But Crispin was too destitute to find
In any commonplace the sought-for aid.
He was a man made vivid by the sea,
A man come out of luminous traversing,
Much trumpeted, made desperately clear,
Fresh from discoveries of tidal skies,
To whom oracular rockings gave no rest.
Into a savage color he went on.
How greatly had he grown in his demesne,
This auditor of insects! He that saw
The stride of vanishing autumn in a park
By way of decorous melancholy; he
That wrote his couplet yearly to the spring,
As dissertation of profound delight,
Stopping, on voyage, in a land of snakes,
Found his vicissitudes had much enlarged
His apprehension, made him intricate
In moody rucks, and difficult and strange
In all desires, his destitution's mark.
He was in this as other freemen are,
Sonorous nutshells rattling inwardly.
His violence was for aggrandizement
And not for stupor, such as music makes
For sleepers halfway waking. He perceived
That coolness for his heat came suddenly,
And only, in the fables that he scrawled
With his own quill, in its indigenous dew,
Of an aesthetic tough, diverse, untamed,
Incredible to prudes, the mint of dirt,
Green barbarism turning paradigm.
Crispin foresaw a curious promenade
Or, nobler, sensed an elemental fate,
And elemental potencies and pangs,
And beautiful barenesses as yet unseen,
Making the most of savagery of palms,
Of moonlight on the thick, cadaverous bloom
That yuccas breed, and of the panther's tread.
The fabulous and its intrinsic verse
Came like two spirits parlaying, adorned
In radiance from the Atlantic coign,
For Crispin and his quill to catechize.
But they came parlaying of such an earth,
So thick with sides and jagged lops of green,
So intertwined with serpent-kin encoiled
Among the purple tufts, the scarlet crowns,
Scenting the jungle in their refuges,
So streaked with yellow, blue and green and red
In beak and bud and fruity gobbet-skins,
That earth was like a jostling festival
Of seeds grown fat, too juicily opulent,
Expanding in the gold's maternal warmth.
So much for that. The affectionate emigrant found
A new reality in parrot-squawks.
Yet let that trifle pass. Now, as this odd
Discoverer walked through the harbor streets
Inspecting the cabildo, the façade
Of the cathedral, making notes, he heard
A rumbling, west of Mexico, it seemed,
Approaching like a gasconade of drums.
The white cabildo darkened, the façade,
As sullen as the sky, was swallowed up
In swift, successive shadows, dolefully.
The rumbling broadened as it fell. The wind,
Tempestuous clarion, with heavy cry,
Came bluntly thundering, more terrible
Than the revenge of music on bassoons.
Gesticulating lightning, mystical,
Made pallid flitter. Crispin, here, took flight.
An annotator has his scruples, too.
He knelt in the cathedral with the rest,
This connoisseur of elemental fate,
Aware of exquisite thought. The storm was one
Of many proclamations of the kind,
Proclaiming something harsher than he learned
From hearing signboards whimper in cold nights
Or seeing the midsummer artifice
Of heat upon his pane. This was the span
Of force, the quintessential fact, the note
Of Vulcan, that a valet seeks to own,
The thing that makes him envious in phrase.
And while the torrent on the roof still droned
He felt the Andean breath. His mind was free
And more than free, elate, intent, profound
And studious of a self possessing him,
That was not in him in the crusty town
From which he sailed. Beyond him, westward, lay
The mountainous ridges, purple balustrades,
In which the thunder, lapsing in its clap,
Let down gigantic quavers of its voice,
For Crispin to vociferate again.                                iii                 Approaching Carolina
The book of moonlight is not written yet
Nor half begun, but, when it is, leave room
For Crispin, fagot in the lunar fire,
Who, in the hubbub of his pilgrimage
Through sweating changes, never could forget
That wakefulness or meditating sleep,
In which the sulky strophes willingly
Bore up, in time, the somnolent, deep songs.
Leave room, therefore, in that unwritten book
For the legendary moonlight that once burned
In Crispin's mind above a continent.
America was always north to him,
A northern west or western north, but north,
And thereby polar, polar-purple, chilled
And lank, rising and slumping from a sea
Of hardy foam, receding flatly, spread
In endless ledges, glittering, submerged
And cold in a boreal mistiness of the moon.
The spring came there in clinking pannicles
Of half-dissolving frost, the summer came,
If ever, whisked and wet, not ripening,
Before the winter's vacancy returned.
The myrtle, if the myrtle ever bloomed,
Was like a glacial pink upon the air.
The green palmettoes in crepuscular ice
Clipped frigidly blue-black meridians,
Morose chiaroscuro, gauntly drawn.
How many poems he denied himself
In his observant progress, lesser things
Than the relentless contact he desired;
How many sea-masks he ignored; what sounds
He shut out from his tempering ear; what thoughts,
Like jades affecting the sequestered bride;
And what descants, he sent to banishment!
Perhaps the Arctic moonlight really gave
The liaison, the blissful liaison,
Between himself and his environment,
Which was, and is, chief motive, first delight,
For him, and not for him alone. It seemed
Elusive, faint, more mist than moon, perverse,
Wrong as a divagation to Peking,
To him that postulated as his theme
The vulgar, as his theme and hymn and flight,
A passionately niggling nightingale.
Moonlight was an evasion, or, if not,
A minor meeting, facile, delicate.
Thus he conceived his voyaging to be
An up and down between two elements,
A fluctuating between sun and moon,
A sally into gold and crimson forms,
As on this voyage, out of goblinry,
And then retirement like a turning back
And sinking down to the indulgences
That in the moonlight have their habitude.
But let these backward lapses, if they would,
Grind their seductions on him, Crispin knew
It was a flourishing tropic he required
For his refreshment, an abundant zone,
Prickly and obdurate, dense, harmonious
Yet with a harmony not rarefied
Nor fined for the inhibited instruments
Of over-civil stops. And thus he tossed
Between a Carolina of old time,
A little juvenile, an ancient whim,
And the visible, circumspect presentment drawn
From what he saw across his vessel's prow.
He came. The poetic hero without palms
Or jugglery, without regalia.
And as he came he saw that it was spring,
A time abhorrent to the nihilist
Or searcher for the fecund minimum.
The moonlight fiction disappeared. The spring,
Although contending featly in its veils,
Irised in dew and early fragrancies,
Was gemmy marionette to him that sought
A sinewy nakedness. A river bore
The vessel inward. Tilting up his nose,
He inhaled the rancid rosin, burly smells
Of dampened lumber, emanations blown
From warehouse doors, the gustiness of ropes,
Decays of sacks, and all the arrant stinks
That helped him round his rude aesthetic out.
He savored rankness like a sensualist.
He marked the marshy ground around the dock,
The crawling railroad spur, the rotten fence,
Curriculum for the marvellous sophomore.
It purified. It made him see how much
Of what he saw he never saw at all.
He gripped more closely the essential prose
As being, in a world so falsified,
The one integrity for him, the one
Discovery still possible to make,
To which all poems were incident, unless
That prose should wear a poem's guise at last.                             iv               The Idea of a Colony
Nota: his soil is man's intelligence.
That's better. That's worth crossing seas to find.
Crispin in one laconic phrase laid bare
His cloudy drift and planned a colony.
Exit the mental moonlight, exit lex,
Rex and principium, exit the whole
Shebang. Exeunt omnes. Here was prose
More exquisite than any tumbling verse:
A still new continent in which to dwell.
What was the purpose of his pilgrimage,
Whatever shape it took in Crispin's mind,
If not, when all is said, to drive away
The shadow of his fellows from the skies,
And, from their stale intelligence released,
To make a new intelligence prevail?
Hence the reverberations in the words
Of his first central hymns, the celebrants
Of rankest trivia, tests of the strength
Of his aesthetic, his philosophy,
The more invidious, the more desired.
The florist asking aid from cabbages,
The rich man going bare, the paladin
Afraid, the blind man as astronomer,
The appointed power unwielded from disdain.
His western voyage ended and began.
The torment of fastidious thought grew slack,
Another, still more bellicose, came on.
He, therefore, wrote his prolegomena,
And, being full of the caprice, inscribed
Commingled souvenirs and prophecies.
He made a singular collation. Thus:
The natives of the rain are rainy men.
Although they paint effulgent, azure lakes,
And April hillsides wooded white and pink,
Their azure has a cloudy edge, their white
And pink, the water bright that dogwood bears.
And in their music showering sounds intone.
On what strange froth does the gross Indian dote,
What Eden sapling gum, what honeyed gore,
What pulpy dram distilled of innocence,
That streaking gold should speak in him
Or bask within his images and words?
If these rude instances impeach themselves
By force of rudeness, let the principle
Be plain. For application Crispin strove,
Abhorring Turk as Esquimau, the lute
As the marimba, the magnolia as rose.
Upon these premises propounding, he
Projected a colony that should extend
To the dusk of a whistling south below the south.
A comprehensive island hemisphere.
The man in Georgia waking among pines
Should be pine-spokesman. The responsive man,
Planting his pristine cores in Florida,
Should prick thereof, not on the psaltery,
But on the banjo's categorical gut,
Tuck tuck, while the flamingos flapped his bays.
Sepulchral señors, bibbing pale mescal,
Oblivious to the Aztec almanacs,
Should make the intricate Sierra scan.
And dark Brazilians in their cafés,
Musing immaculate, pampean dits,
Should scrawl a vigilant anthology,
To be their latest, lucent paramour.
These are the broadest instances. Crispin,
Progenitor of such extensive scope,
Was not indifferent to smart detail.
The melon should have apposite ritual,
Performed in verd apparel, and the peach,
When its black branches came to bud, belle day,
Should have an incantation. And again,
When piled on salvers its aroma steeped
The summer, it should have a sacrament
And celebration. Shrewd novitiates
Should be the clerks of our experience.
These bland excursions into time to come,
Related in romance to backward flights,
However prodigal, however proud,
Contained in their afflatus the reproach
That first drove Crispin to his wandering.
He could not be content with counterfeit,
With masquerade of thought, with hapless words
That must belie the racking masquerade,
With fictive flourishes that preordained
His passion's permit, hang of coat, degree
Of buttons, measure of his salt. Such trash
Might help the blind, not him, serenely sly.
It irked beyond his patience. Hence it was,
Preferring text to gloss, he humbly served
Grotesque apprenticeship to chance event,
A clown, perhaps, but an aspiring clown.
There is a monotonous babbling in our dreams
That makes them our dependent heirs, the heirs
Of dreamers buried in our sleep, and not
The oncoming fantasies of better birth.
The apprentice knew these dreamers. If he dreamed
Their dreams, he did it in a gingerly way.
All dreams are vexing. Let them be expunged.
But let the rabbit run, the cock declaim.
Trinket pasticcio, flaunting skyey sheets,
With Crispin as the tiptoe cozener?
No, no: veracious page on page, exact.                                v                 A Nice Shady Home
Crispin as hermit, pure and capable,
Dwelt in the land. Perhaps if discontent
Had kept him still the pricking realist,
Choosing his element from droll confect
Of was and is and shall or ought to be,
Beyond Bordeaux, beyond Havana, far
Beyond carked Yucatan, he might have come
To colonize his polar planterdom
And jig his chits upon a cloudy knee.
But his emprize to that idea soon sped.
Crispin dwelt in the land and dwelling there
Slid from his continent by slow recess
To things within his actual eye, alert
To the difficulty of rebellious thought
When the sky is blue. The blue infected will.
It may be that the yarrow in his fields
Sealed pensive purple under its concern.
But day by day, now this thing and now that
Confined him, while it cosseted, condoned,
Little by little, as if the suzerain soil
Abashed him by carouse to humble yet
Attach. It seemed haphazard denouement.
He first, as realist, admitted that
Whoever hunts a matinal continent
May, after all, stop short before a plum
And be content and still be realist.
The words of things entangle and confuse.
The plum survives its poems. It may hang
In the sunshine placidly, colored by ground
Obliquities of those who pass beneath,
Harlequined and mazily dewed and mauved
In bloom. Yet it survives in its own form,
Beyond these changes, good, fat, guzzly fruit.
So Crispin hasped on the surviving form,
For him, of shall or ought to be in is.
Was he to bray this in profoundest brass
Arointing his dreams with fugal requiems?
Was he to company vastest things defunct
With a blubber of tom-toms harrowing the sky?
Scrawl a tragedian's testament? Prolong
His active force in an inactive dirge,
Which, let the tall musicians call and call,
Should merely call him dead? Pronounce amen
Through choirs infolded to the outmost clouds?
Because he built a cabin who once planned
Loquacious columns by the ructive sea?
Because he turned to salad-beds again?
Jovial Crispin, in calamitous crape?
Should he lay by the personal and make
Of his own fate an instance of all fate?
What is one man among so many men?
What are so many men in such a world?
Can one man think one thing and think it long?
Can one man be one thing and be it long?
The very man despising honest quilts
Lies quilted to his poll in his despite.
For realists, what is is what should be.
And so it came, his cabin shuffled up,
His trees were planted, his duenna brought
Her prismy blonde and clapped her in his hands,
The curtains flittered and the door was closed.
Crispin, magister of a single room,
Latched up the night. So deep a sound fell down
It was as if the solitude concealed
And covered him and his congenial sleep.
So deep a sound fell down it grew to be
A long soothsaying silence down and down.
The crickets beat their tambours in the wind,
Marching a motionless march, custodians.
In the presto of the morning, Crispin trod,
Each day, still curious, but in a round
Less prickly and much more condign than that
He once thought necessary. Like Candide,
Yeoman and grub, but with a fig in sight,
And cream for the fig and silver for the cream,
A blonde to tip the silver and to taste
The rapey gouts. Good star, how that to be
Annealed them in their cabin ribaldries!
Yet the quotidian saps philosophers
And men like Crispin like them in intent,
If not in will, to track the knaves of thought.
But the quotidian composed as his,
Of breakfast ribands, fruits laid in their leaves,
The tomtit and the cassia and the rose,
Although the rose was not the noble thorn
Of crinoline spread, but of a pining sweet,
Composed of evenings like cracked shutters flung
Upon the rumpling bottomness, and nights
In which those frail custodians watched,
Indifferent to the tepid summer cold,
While he poured out upon the lips of her
That lay beside him, the quotidian
Like this, saps like the sun, true fortuner.
For all it takes it gives a humped return
Exchequering from piebald fiscs unkeyed.                               vi           And Daughters with Curls
Portentous enunciation, syllable
To blessed syllable affined, and sound
Bubbling felicity in cantilene,
Prolific and tormenting tenderness
Of music, as it comes to unison,
Forgather and bell boldly Crispin's last
Deduction. Thrum, with a proud douceur
His grand pronunciamento and devise.
The chits came for his jigging, bluet-eyed,
Hands without touch yet touching poignantly,
Leaving no room upon his cloudy knee,
Prophetic joint, for its diviner young.
The return to social nature, once begun,
Anabasis or slump, ascent or chute,
Involved him in midwifery so dense
His cabin counted as phylactery,
Then place of vexing palankeens, then haunt
Of children nibbling at the sugared void,
Infants yet eminently old, then dome
And halidom for the unbraided femes,
Green crammers of the green fruits of the world,
Bidders and biders for its ecstasies,
True daughters both of Crispin and his clay.
All this with many mulctings of the man,
Effective colonizer sharply stopped
In the door-yard by his own capacious bloom.
But that this bloom grown riper, showing nibs
Of its eventual roundness, puerile tints
Of spiced and weathery rouges, should complex
The stopper to indulgent fatalist
Was unforeseen. First Crispin smiled upon
His goldenest demoiselle, inhabitant,
She seemed, of a country of the capuchins,
So delicately blushed, so humbly eyed,
Attentive to a coronal of things
Secret and singular. Second, upon
A second similar counterpart, a maid
Most sisterly to the first, not yet awake
Excepting to the motherly footstep, but
Marvelling sometimes at the shaken sleep.
Then third, a thing still flaxen in the light,
A creeper under jaunty leaves. And fourth,
Mere blusteriness that gewgaws jollified,
All din and gobble, blasphemously pink.
A few years more and the vermeil capuchin
Gave to the cabin, lordlier than it was,
The dulcet omen fit for such a house.
The second sister dallying was shy
To fetch the one full-pinioned one himself
Out of her botches, hot embosomer.
The third one gaping at the orioles
Lettered herself demurely as became
A pearly poetess, peaked for rhapsody.
The fourth, pent now, a digit curious.
Four daughters in a world too intricate
In the beginning, four blithe instruments
Of differing struts, four voices several
In couch, four more personæ, intimate
As buffo, yet divers, four mirrors blue
That should be silver, four accustomed seeds
Hinting incredible hues, four self-same lights
That spread chromatics in hilarious dark,
Four questioners and four sure answerers.
Crispin concocted doctrine from the rout.
The world, a turnip once so readily plucked,
Sacked up and carried overseas, daubed out
Of its ancient purple, pruned to the fertile main,
And sown again by the stiffest realist,
Came reproduced in purple, family font,
The same insoluble lump. The fatalist
Stepped in and dropped the chuckling down his craw,
Without grace or grumble. Score this anecdote
Invented for its pith, not doctrinal
In form though in design, as Crispin willed,
Disguised pronunciamento, summary,
Autumn's compendium, strident in itself
But muted, mused, and perfectly revolved
In those portentous accents, syllables,
And sounds of music coming to accord
Upon his law, like their inherent sphere,
Seraphic proclamations of the pure
Delivered with a deluging onwardness.
Or if the music sticks, if the anecdote
Is false, if Crispin is a profitless
Philosopher, beginning with green brag,
Concluding fadedly, if as a man
Prone to distemper he abates in taste,
Fickle and fumbling, variable, obscure,
Glozing his life with after-shining flicks,
Illuminating, from a fancy gorged
By apparition, plain and common things,
Sequestering the fluster from the year,
Making gulped potions from obstreperous drops,
And so distorting, proving what he proves
Is nothing, what can all this matter since
The relation comes, benignly, to its end?
So may the relation of each man be clipped.

Unlike the monarch, though
the asteroid also slipped
quietly from its colony
on its annular migration
between Jupiter and Mars,
enticed maybe by
our planetary pollen
as the monarch by my neighbor’s
slender-leaved milkweed.
Unlike it even when
the fragrant Cretaceous
atmosphere meteorized
the airborne rock,
flaring it into what might
have looked to the horrid
triceratops like a monarch
ovipositing (had the butterfly
begun before the period
broke off). Not much like
the monarch I met when I
rushed out the door for the 79,
though the sulfurous dust
from the meteoric impact
off the Yucatán took flight
for all corners of the heavens

took wing from the milkweed
for their annual migration
to the west of the Yucatán,
and their unburdened mother
took her final flit
up my flagstone walkway,

          The way to the toy store was blocked by a fallen tree
in the road. There was a policeman directing traffic down a
side street. I asked him, “What happened?” He said, “Lightning
in the night.” I took the turn and drove down the street
looking for a way to turn back. Other streets were blocked by
fallen trees, and I couldn’t find a way back to the toy store.
I kept driving and soon I was on the outskirts of town. I
got on a highway and drove, soon forgetting the toy store and
what I was supposed to get there. I drove on as if I was hypno-
tized, not noticing the signs for turnoffs. I must have driven
a couple of hours before I woke up, then I took the next exit
and had no idea where I was. I drove down a straight tree-lined
lane with farm houses on either side. There was a lake at the
end of the lane. I pulled over and parked. I got out and
started walking. There were several docks along the shore.
I walked out on one and watched the ducks swimming and diving.
There was something bobbing in the middle of the lake. I stared
at it for a long time before I realized it was a man’s head.
Then, a moment later, it was a coconut. No, it was an old tire
floating right side up. I gave up and started following the
ducks. They would suddenly fly up and circle the lake and
come down and splash land again. It was quite entertaining.
A man walked up behind me and said, “This government lake is
off-limits to the public. You’ll have to leave.” I said,
“I didn’t know it was a government lake. Why should it be
off-limits?” He said, “I’m sorry. You’ll have to leave.”
“I don’t even know where I am,” I said. “You’ll still have
to leave,” he said. “What about that man out there?” I said,
pointing to the tire. “He’s dead,” he said. “No, he’s not.
I just saw him move his arm,” I said. He removed his pistol from
his holster and fired a shot. “Now he’s dead,” he said.

          Mitzy fell asleep as soon as we got home, but I didn’t.
The evening had upset me. Why did Jack keep asking me if I’d
been married before? And why did my answer not satisfy him?
It was probably just a bad joke. Jack’s humor is off sometimes.
But he’s not a bad guy. Well, then I went to bed. When we woke up
in the morning Mitzy said, “Jack was right about you, wasn’t he?”
“What do you mean?” I said. “Jack said you were kicked out of
the Army,” she said. “I was never in the Army, how could I be
kicked out?” I said. “I don’t think he likes me.” “Oh, I think
Jack likes you a lot. He just wishes you were more interesting,”
she said. “And by making me secretly divorced and secretly kicked
out of the Army I’m instantly more interesting, is that it?” I
said. “According to Jack you are,” she said. “I think we had better
have breakfast,” I said. “Good idea,” she said. During breakfast
I said, “Don’t you think I’m interesting?” “Of course I do, honey,”
she said. “Let’s forget it. I mean, Jack is an old friend. Maybe
he was just drunk,” I said. “That’s probably it,” she said.
“What are you going to do today?” I asked. “I’m thinking of buying
a new dress for the wedding,” she said. “What wedding?” I said.
“You know, Carol and Bob’s wedding, next Saturday,” she said.
“Oh God, I forgot all about it,” I said. “How could you forget?
Bob’s your best friend,” she said. “I know, I just had my mind
on other things, but now I’ll focus on their wedding, I promise,”
I said. Shortly after that Mitzy left the house. I cleaned up
the breakfast dishes, then sat down on the couch. Why had Jack told
the two secrets I had told him years ago. I had sworn him to
silence, and now everybody knew. I had told him I would kill
him if he ever told anybody. I wasn’t going to kill him, but I
did think about disappearing, just vanishing altogether. Where
would I go? What would I do? And I do love Mitzy. I could tell
her the truth. I’ve had eighteen years to do that, and not a
squeak so far.

          My wife and I were spending a quiet night at home. She was reading
a magazine on the couch and I was reading my novel in my chair. I said,
“Darling, can I fix you a cup of hot chocolate?” She said, “That would
be great.” So I got up and went into the kitchen and started to boil the
milk. A few minutes later I handed her the cup. “Hmmm, smells great.
Thank you, darling,” she said. I sat down and resumed my reading. She
said, “Did you know a tiger has the same number of bones in it as a monkey?”
“I don’t believe it,” I said. “And a whale has the same number as a mouse.”
“Get out of here,” I said. “These are some little known facts discovered
by a man named John D. Baxter,” she said. “He must be crazy,” I said.
Then we were quiet for a while. I looked over and she was asleep. I went
on reading my novel. Then I put my novel down and got up and started to
tiptoe around the house. I went into our bedroom and over to the dresser.
I opened up Mitzy’s jewelry box and let the jewels run through my fingers.
There were some fantastic pieces in there, diamonds, rubies, emeralds. I
thought about stealing some, but felt creepy about it. I put them back in
the box and tiptoed back into the living room. I tripped on the coffee table
and went crashing down. Mitzy woke with a start. “Go back to sleep,”
I said. “What was that?” she said. “I tripped, that’s all,” I said.
She started to get up. “Where are you going?” I said. “I want to look in
my jewelry box,” she said. “Why?” I said. “I dreamed somebody was trying
to steal something in there,” she said. She went into the bedroom and
looked in the box, then came out. “It’s okay,” she said. “Well, I’m glad,”
I said. She got back on the couch and picked up her magazine. “Did you
know jellyfish have bigger brains than humans?” she said. “I don’t believe
it,” I said. “Well, they do. It says right here,” she said.

you won’t,” he said. I walked out the door feeling really good. Of
course I knew I was going to die, but still the day looked bright to
me. I walked down to the water. Ducks were circling around and about.
A sailboat sailed by. I walked along the shore. The sun beat down
on me. I felt as though I might live forever. I sat down on a bench
and watched the joggers pass. A pretty blonde walked by and I said,
“Hello.” She looked at me and said hello. A man with a greyhound
on a leash walked by. I got up and started to walk. A woodpecker
was pounding on a tree. An airplane flew over, leaving a thick trail of
smoke. I left the lake and walked on up the road. I crossed at the
streetlights and crossed the bridge. A car swerved to miss me. I
thought, that could have been it, the end right there, but I walked on,
bravely dodging the cars. When I got to the residential district, I
felt relieved. There were large elms and maples overhanging the street,
and people pushing baby carriages. Dogs ran loose everywhere. A man
stopped me and asked if I knew where 347 Walnut Street was. I said
I didn’t. He said, “Oh well, it didn’t matter anyway.” I said, “Why?”
He said it was a funeral notice. I walked on, bumping into a fat lady
with a load of groceries. I said I was sorry. She kept going, dropping
a load of grapefruit. Then, further on, there was a giant explosion across
the street. Police and firemen were there right away. It appears it
was a gas main beneath the shop. No one was there, luckily, but the
firetrucks had their hands full. I left before it was out. The shop
was pretty much destroyed. When I got home I was tired. I made
myself a cup of tea and sat down on the couch. I thought about calling
my mother, but she was in heaven. I called her anyway. “Mom, how are
you doing?” I said. “I’m bored. Don’t come here. There’s nothing to
do,” she said. “Aren’t there angels?” I said. “Yes, but they’re boring,”
she said. “But I was going to come see you,” I said. “Go to hell, it’s
more exciting,” she said. I had fallen asleep with my teacup in my
hand. When I awoke I realized I had thought it was a phone. My
mother would never be so sarcastic about heaven.

History wants a great beauty

And who of highest power

available briefly, far away?
There’s something classical
about her appetite, about the chain

It proves how far we’ve come,

If all the dead exist in the underworld, does the underworld occur outside of time, what does that mean for your father, through what magic will you locate your father who has only just arrived, has always only just departed, only just deported, did you don a suit and loiter on the highway your hands gripping a giant gilt-framed photograph of him and what questions did you interview at all who passed those vampires and angels you encountered, can you state for the record the moan you heard the ghosts emit across the nation-state,,, wuaahh buu,,, did you perform three miracles for a virile hag a witch with universes for eyes and did you request in barter a single boon his location or did you unlock his location using a skeleton, are we all a line assembled from white keys of death and is this song the sonata we hear when we press those keys, was your tool to search for him a wishbone, did you slice the wishbone from the breast of a monstrous old god, who was the god, what was his username, was it one of the ghost-giants you fled from terrified that he may have glimpsed even a shred of you, was it the famished god who grabs small ghosts to its mouth and slurps down their marrow, was it a devourer whose fingerprints leak out red tears in hysterical shame, was it Francisco Pizarro, was it King Leopold, did you see Joe Arpaio levitating each leg borne aloft by flying police cars, did you see Winston Churchill that infant-faced faminist turning loose new Emergencies, was it Andrew Jackson mounting a scorpion across that moist trail this pilgrimage for creating new ghosts, did the ghosts cry out wwuu wah,,,,,,,,, how did you kill the god, is revolutionary politics the name for deicide,, a wa wa,,,, is the translation for that moan “god grief!” did you slay the god with smallpox or pistols, hemlock or Maxim, London debt or land grants or fantasies or plague blankets or kryptonite, was it patricide, did you pry your fingers into his rib cage, did you hold the bone’s moist handles up into the sky and poke that plump cloud with your dowsing rod, did the stick sniff out your father from this city of ghosts until this wet rod twitched, until the witching stick tugged you through hell’s alleyways, until you arrived here at this modest house, what category of building is the house that contains your father, until you found a prison, until you found a shadowless space where he waited underneath a star, is death the story of until, is death the story you came to untell, did the light emit a silence like hssssssshs, this light the star wept—was it a message from the past strewn across black heaven, an emergency beacon from a plague universe calling help help from masters and money, what sound do you hear arrayed against you (here the ghost chorus leaps and screams keke keke!), did the star halt above that house like a police chopper spotlight, basking its blue heat on your skin, was this when the star’s strange beams obliterated your shadow, did you cry no please my shadow is all I have here, did you say without my shadow I am a ghost, without my shadow I have no history, how did you feel when the star cried and wailed down its weep-light in fragile pink lineaments, did you see the star throned above where your father may be waiting, is your father the king who sleeps in a cave beneath the city or does his life continue in this mute house, is he washing the dishes as we speak, is he talking on the phone in that loud way of his, is he watching a K-Drama while eating 牛 肉 麵, did he clip the soup’s recipe from that most authentic of sources Gourmet magazine, had you bought him the subscription for his birthday and was his reply to you months later, “Fine, these French can cook but take away butter and they don’t know how to do anything,” (hahahahaha say the ghosts) was that many years ago now in fact probably a decade, did you just glance down at your wristwatch to show how many days are left in your very own life, do the manic watch hands ratchet around like helicopter blades chuh chuh chuh, were you given this watch from your future self that renegade timelord, do you have the time, is time something one can possess or does it soar away from us on outspread wings, but doesn’t Dōgen say that time does not fly since it does not exist outside of us, is it impossible to exist outside the underworld, did you open the front door to the house and see the living room from your childhood, the white Naugahyde couch preserving the dark halo that he cast when he dozed off during his hair dye, the cubic light of a TV luminous solely from VHF, and framed by the window: a blue Honda, car of his youth!,,, these nostalgic recreations do they make you wonder if you had somehow time traveled to a coordinate outside of the underworld, traveled to the past, or would it be more accurate to say that we are already inside the underworld, that the apocalypse is not a spectacle but what elapses as we speak, what does it mean to speak,, ha ha blah blah blah,,,, did you tour the house of memory saying nothing, did you find the doors to each room shut, all handles locked, is this how your waking brain prohibits all fantasies, is it true that they have outlawed dreams, who is they, did you come to your bedroom door and open your wallet to take out your key, did you see on a dollar the face of an evil god, did Andrew Jackson wink at you from the currency and bare his fangs hsss sa sa,,,,,,, was this when the five dollar bill singed you, did the sign of the apocalyptic populist ignite and burn out the grooves from your fingerprints, how loud did you holler shocked, did your wallet keep falling into the floor and never stop, did the floor wobble like a trampoline, did a menacing voice laugh and say on god’s intercom here is your shadow catch, did you fall through the hole in the carpet, did you land in one of the old sewers and in the distance see someone sleeping on a stone slab, was it a body curled to the side uncovered by any blanket, did you talk on the phone with the woman from the ambulance, was it true that your sister and your stepmother saw his body covered only with a sheet, did the woman tell you what she had seen and do you remember telling her “You have a terrible job—you must tell everyone that the one they love has died,” did you recognize her when you entered this place and saw the Recording Angel, is the occupation of that archivist of prayers: writer, did the sleeping figure roll back as though on an airport conveyer, do the walls of the cave inch closer to strangle you, is the underworld a prison since those who enter it have no right to return, who will rescue you, who will rescue you now that you have lathered yourself with cave, is it true that you have forgotten how to breathe, did you aspire to be as breathless as the ghosts who populate this place or did you just have a bad day, would you like to stop, would you like to stop and catch your breath huh huhh huh, did you simultaneously call your expression narcissism and your restraint self-loathing, doubly self-damning, have you been given permission to forgive yourself, shall you ask the mirror Uncle what ails thee, what about your dowsing rod, will you wish for water, wish for air, witch for heir, did you tap your bone wand to the gray rocks repressing you, did the earth and its baroque caverns transpire into the simple night about you, did you look down through the wind from a ship sailing dark heights, did you find the ship’s steadiness strange given that nothing supported you above sky and city, well is the air nothing, was it the Maya who said that soul was simply breath, is the soul nothing, what if you crept into the airship’s spacious caverns and saw not helium but a palace of flowers, what if the entire vessel had been borne up by the exhalations of flowers their breath tasting sweet into the air, what if this was the world, what if you lived on a planet that had grown itself from the souls of flowers, did you once believe that grief was the philosopher’s stone whose touch silenced all spacetime into dark matter, on Sunday did you meet a man at the market who had returned to Haiti the day before the earthquake, did he tell you what that taught him, was the lesson to quit his job and love his daughter and begin afresh, did he remind you that you imagine the world for your child, is the poet what we name the vocation of love and freedom, on that first summer day in March did your child’s grandparents text you Christos Anesti, did you sit yourself down in the airship’s aisles unsuspended by clouds and float in the silver air, buoyed by nothing so magical as resurrection, did you take a deep breath and accept an in-flight complimentary beverage, did you gaze out the window at the spill of stars and think no not stars, the lights of the city, each one lit by a soul below?

We come to the city; we embrace the pantheon,

They want to be villagers again.
Just when you began to distinguish
the sound of your history from its echo,
they want to be villagers again.
You must not kill their sacred animal;
you must give up your taboo for theirs
for they want to be villagers again.
Sunlight and shadow is what made this rose, you say,
a god who could not have arisen elsewhere
but they want to be villagers again.
The twist in your tongue is the river’s song.
It’s how your feet walk now, how your fingers strum,
but they want to be villagers again.
The dusk of their coffee, their muddy water booze,
the herb of life shooting out of the impeccable concrete,
but they want to be villagers again.
You point to salt escaping the sea’s hold—
a vision of a tundra reclaiming the desiccated grass,
but they want to be villagers again.
You build terraces for the ancient woods to breathe,

He started out making feluccas;
an Egyptian taught him how.
Then he opened a shop by the beach,
sold ice cream, parasols and chairs.
He asked for my hand when I was
in teacher college, first year.
Time passes like the Ghibli here.
I was 7 months with my third baby
when someone sought him
for a Zodiac. He traveled all the way
to Guangzhou, brought back a dozen,
has been selling them ever since.
One night I asked how strong
they were, how many they carry.
“It’s all in the booklet,” he said,
“no reason for what keeps happening
to them.” He sipped from a glass
of bokha and explained how
from this same jetty, long before
the Arabs and Vandals, even before
the Romans and their famous theater,
boats filled with people and goods
and sailed off. A day or a week later,
the sea sends back the drowned.
His long-lashed eyes closed when
he spoke, his face unchanged by the years.
His fingers moved so carefully
putting out his cigarette. He saw me
looking, nodded, then pulled me toward
his manhood to help him sleep.

ONE
The First Invention, ear laid to earth, is listening
to the fingerlength underground beings moving in segments
through tiny tunnels; one inch shrugs out another,
as bamboo climbs in segments, joint by green joint ...
Or an inexpressive mask that must travel
the world, uphill and down, always keeping its own
counsel, impelling  forward from inward—
unspelling a logic that cannot look out or see.
Or a thought that recurs, till one wonders
whether Bach’s theme, without cause, or pause,
is like a cat in a night-closet, the cat evenly leaping
from level to level; the theme that sinks down
into one hand, next leaps to the other, reprises itself,
then doubles down softly, a counterpane on a shelf.
SIX
Have you ever noticed, in Piranesi’s Carcerid’invenzione, the tiny repeating figures in the foreground?
Brittle, frugal, fugal, they ignore that above them
stairways rise out of sight, and somewhere else
collapse, in-swallowed, devolving through walls or domes.
The same way Bach’s motive splays out to the right,
swoons flatly, swans it, footnotes, follows up,
talks to itself, purls, mutters, dawdles, resumes ...
Six is playing at infancy, one three five,
that’s all Baby knows, a block pile clumsily building.
Then the tall chord falls sideways—pretends
it’s a melody—everyone knows it’s a chord—
or a problem in long division which at one point just sticks
on that endless, that déjà vu decimal, six six six ...
ELEVEN
Eleven is caterpillars, two, marching: the one
stave of thick-barred sixteenth notes set down
precisely beneath the other, tiptoe to toetip,
close-clinging, rising and falling and mirrored:
one looks down and locks the other’s horns,
or its own; the two could be said to be linked
like the locked yet endlessly out-spiraling
spindled ribbons of DNA. Yet there’s something
scary, like Cicero’s dizzying concept
of motus animi, hurtling mind unstoppably inventing
figures on figures, yet with no vanishing point,
a world of ladders or stairwells
where space keeps revolving, welling up into space
endless, unfree, unfolding like stairs in a case.

[For J.A.]



After the wind just stops you still hear
the wind’s wild almost, its approach and retreat, and how it kept
circling as-if-trying, as if about-to-be, an almost-speech,
loud and full of syntax casting about for
life, form, limit, fate. To be bodied. To strut. To have
meaning. How easily we wear ourselves
as if it is nothing to have
origin, whirl, outcome, end      and still be.
After the high winds stop you’re forced to hear
the freshness of what’s
there. It smacks, shimmers—this sound of
the scarcely there, the adamantly almost, all betweens, sub-­
siding till adjustment—and then the re-blanketing evenness sets in ... Gone
all that acceleration shooting up and back, futurist, wild with naming and naming
its one price. Oh nothing holds. Just the rattling of the going and
coming together of things, as if matter itself is trying
to find something true to
say—crazed investigation, tentative prophecy trying on savage
shape, figure, progression—widening without be-
coming. Is this the last war now, finally—but no, only more of notion’s
motions—more more the wind says, break grief, loosen possibility, let vague
hopes float, sink—let other debris slip into
their place. Rootless mind. Shallow whirling of  law and more and yet more law
brocading the emptiness. Then suddenly
all stills. It is near noon. No more
spillage. No more gorgeous waste of effort. No more upgathering,
out-tossed reachings of green as if imagining some out there exists—hovering
inhalations, then as-if-hiding, then all coughed-out at once in a tumble— too much,
too many, disconcerted, uncountable. Yet no dream ...
After the wind stops you hear fact. You hear fact’s plan. It is huge.
The tree does not escape. Things are finished forces.
You hear a name-call from far off, tossed, dropped. Someone gives up.
Light rips here from there. Where birdcalls cease, you hear the under-
neath. Try living again day’s long pitched syllable-ooze
hums after the high winds stop & your final footprint lifts off & no matterhow cleanyou want it to be
nothing is ever going to be gone enough. Oh. Oak, show us up.
Indecipherable green sound us. Stilled leaf-chatter quiver up
again, rustle the secret rule we’ll never catch in
time. To be late is to be alive. This Sunday. All things are
mention of themselves—as the dog barks, the air conditioner
scours its air—and each thing takes its place. But look, keenly, adamantly
a road has appeared—a sense that something is happening striates
the open air—there is a limping in the light, a tiny withdrawal of light from
light, which makes a form in the gully—you haven’t changed much it
says—children still appearing out of nowhere now, so violently heavy with
life, they dart, they breed, you be a ghost now the surrounding tunes up,
as if it is all going to begin again, though this time without you
standing here noticing.... So notice is given. The look on the light
is that of an argument about to be made and won.
Yes you were underneath history for this while,
you were able to write the history of being underneath,
you were able to disappear and make the rest appear.
But now it wants its furious place again, all floral and full of appearance,
full of its fourth wall, its silvery after-tomorrow,
and ramping-up now quite a spectacular dusk.
This page is turning. It is full of mattering. Our unrealized project glows in
your mind. The animals lift their heads for an instant then back.
New shoots in the parched field. All the details are important you think but
no, even the ruins look like they might be fake—important but fake—
though we must learn what they have to teach then push them back
deep into the light. This is the way it is it murmurs, circling,
out here in the middle of summer. Which summer was it which was
the last of the summers. All the children are returned home. Day turns its windless
folio. You stay it says. We pass here now onto the next-on world. You stay.

Does realism get your vote? It gets mine.
The plants with their insatiable thirst for appearances,
the heart-stopping 7:00 p.m. air moonlighting as a pressed-cardboard Korean ashtray
(server, modest coaster) decorated with a single blondish branch
holding six leaves and a piece of rose-colored fruit (pear, plum, ripe peach)
slightly raised as if applied to the flat, creamy space behind
flecked with light gray, light green, and brown marks of varying size
from pinpricks to ashes, pencil (it looks like) to brush.
The romance of the windowpanes (I’m squinting a little) has nothing
to do with the misguided view, the one with the Fates schmoozing
under the maroon awning of the high-rise (schmoos is more like it)
and the embarrassed-looking sycamores revealing for all they’re worth
in their slightly fictionalized but emotionally accurate way, which  contributes to the overall tone
without detracting from the realistic participation,
a motorbike taking the corner too fast, a cat knowing the worst that can possibly happen and managing to avoid it,
which could be the key signature if not for a free-standing
radiance just outside, unmoored, a hint of plum or Anjou pear.

Mortality is itself immortal Leo thought, reminded five
years later of the performance. Having come, despite his
Irish darkness, to resemble one of the Carrot clan
himself. Whatever he had read, and the feelings that went
along with those books, articles and poems, layered his
unconscious now like lava. What was the voice of that
moment, he questioned his uni-ball pen. The playing
fingers, the singer, the wind that came in and made King
Carrot pop his collar. As even the King’d say now, after
Usher. Usher’ll die like everyone else but not for a few
decades yet, touch head. Where Leo wandered as if
streets were wild with flowers rather than construction
Mortality was in memory: mortality was immortality
even. Quotidian checking, marking, jogging things along
(e.g. the economy) these are the columns and emojis of
obituary. The privileged sublime? The working artist
reading the world under a misprinted title, taking
pills to still contradiction, lines of sky gray, and
greenery (tracing the eyeline of buildings’ weed
mascara). The forcing of life through an earth crumbling
with fatigue and love gone wrong: or was that the
humans standing on it? Yes, we all needed some grace
to get from one side of town to the other. And how have
a career without going up some real stone steps? To see
things and write them up, whether on bench or phone
while stopping, or on a keyboard once home. To Leo
death was always shocking: whether blighted cornfield
defunct toaster or road possum. Anything might’ve had
poison tipped into its ear: think of Carrot III slumping as
the piano lid closed, and knocking a candle over. The
singer leaping from her stool, suffocating the flames
before giving the gift of life, making every line she’d
sang that night seem crucial. That’s what Leo—and
probably everyone else who was there—remembered, if
only because a new song about superficial human life
(“A river is thicker than royal blood”) soon ruled the air

What injures the hive injures the bee, says Marcus Aurelius. I say
not wanting to hurt another, this late, should maybe more than
count, still, as a form of love. Be wild. Bewilder. Not that they
hadn’t, of course, known unkindnesses, and been themselves
unkind. When the willow’s leaves, back again, unfold all along
their branches, the branches routinely in turn brushing then lifting
away from the pond’s face, it’s too late. Last night I doubted as I’ve
not doubted myself in years: knowing a thing seemed worthless
next to knowing the difference between many things, the fox from
the hounds, persuasion from the trust required to fall asleep beside
a stranger; who I am, and how I treated you, and how you feel. So
that it almost seemed they’d either forgotten or agreed without
saying so to pretend they had. Did you know there’s an actual plant
called honesty, for its seedpods, how you can see straight through?
Though they’d been told the entire grove would die eventually, they
refused to believe it. The face in sleep, like a wish wasted. To the wings
at first a slight unsteadiness; then barely any. What if forgetting’s not
like that—instead, stampeding, panicked, just a ghost choir: of legends,
and rumors, of the myths forged from memory—what’s true, and isn’t—
that we make of ourselves and, even worse, of others. Not the all-but-
muscular ache, the inner sweep of woundedness; no. Not tonight. Say
the part again about the bluer flower, black at the edges. I’ve always
loved that part. Skull of an ox, from which a smattering of stars
keeps rising. How they decided never to use surrender as a word again.

From the sequence “Shekhinah Speaks”

Comfort, comfort my people ...
—Isaiah 40:1



A voice says, “Your punishment has ended.”
You never listen to that voice. You really suck
at being comforted.
Another voice says, “Cry.”
That voice always gets your attention,
keeps you thinking
about withered flowers and withering grass
and all the ways you’re like them.
Hard to argue with that.
Death tramples you, an un-housebroken pet
trailing prints and broken stems,
pooping anxiety, PTSD, depression.
It’s better to be animal than vegetable
but best of all is to be spirit
flying first or maybe business class
with your emotional support animal, your body,
curled in your lap, soaring with you
above the sense of loss you’ve mistaken
for the closest to God you can get.
You want to cry? Cry about that.
Who do you think created
the animals to whom you turn for comfort,
dogs, miniature horses, monkeys, ferrets,
hungers you know how to feed,
fears you know how to quiet?
I form them, fur them,
it’s my warmth radiating from their bodies,
my love that answers
the love you lavish upon them.
Your deserts and desolations
are highways I travel,
smoothing your broken places,
arranging stars and constellations
to light your wilderness.
Sometimes I play the shepherd;
sometimes I play the lamb;
sometimes I appear as death,
which makes it hard to remember
that I am the one who assembled your atoms,
who crowned your dust with consciousness.
I take you everywhere,
which is why, wherever you go, I’m there,
keeping you hydrated, stroking your hair,
laughing when you chase your tail,
gathering you to my invisible breasts
more tenderly than any mother.
You’re right—you never asked for this. I’m the reason
your valleys are being lifted up,
the source of your life laid bare.
Mine is the voice that decrees—
that begs—your anguish to end.
When you suffer, I suffer.
Comfort me
by being comforted.

Honey-sweet song
—Pindar



Standing, leaning, with both long-
clawed paws she rips punk
wood out of a tree with
a high hollow to get
at her cause inside—her sharp brute
parentheses tear at the living
humming word. The honey
the tree has helped the bees
hide has drawn her near with
its scent. Forcing the issue,
she’s heavy, off-balance, intent.
Flying defenders of the sweet
they’ve produced and on
which they and their larvae
depend, the bees swarm her
nose, her eyes, her tongue, her plan,
often they trace with their hovering
the lying-down eight of infinity
before they sting and fall
mortally self-wounded.
Yet always in this valor they fail
to defend—and who can succeed?—
the whole history of poetry.

We shelter an angel whom we never cease to offend. We ought to be the guardians of that angel.
—Jean Cocteau



A scherzo of thumbnail butterflies, white ones,
Covers the hillside. God is more
Adorable than music. Nevertheless,
On a given morning, as the wind drops,
Music pries Heaven apart from itself,
Like flowers beneath the wings unfolded on them.
Every breeze is self-registering.
This morning, I walked deeper into the hill,
Free of the sun. Midway up the tallest trees,
One leaf alone would stir while all the leaves
On the very same branch remained stock-still.
Apart from itself, Heaven signaled to me.
William Blake was no romantic. He was,
Beyond the arsons of levity and his toe,
The final bulwark of the baroque.
He was the last to oppose, “almost
Successfully,” rebirth on all the wrong terms.
He saw the leaf alone where no light was.
Infinite variation plays against
A steadfast variety. The butterfly
Knows the difference in its wings, even
As the flower she alights upon darkens
Beneath her weight. The sun goes deeper
Into the hill. Root systems and riot shine.
Did you think for a moment Earth
Was aware of itself? Never. Its adoration
Persists altogether elsewhere from
The very beginning, beginning again
Just at that moment one leaf all alone
Spins into the baroque, a scherzo of one note.
The hillside is covered with little doors,
And the wind rises out of them, returning,
When the music is spent, with all the news
Of the unaware, unreflecting, nearly perfect
Hours blindly about the business of perfection.
Hence the tiny eyes on a butterfly’s wing.
Rebirth is an idiot. Isolated
Each into its own eternity,
Like every pain, birth continues out of mind
Deeper into the hill. Earth riots
With levity. Darkness swims into light.
Flowers begin to imagine the life of flowers.
Heaven signals to me, pouring down shade
Out of the canopy of trees, prying
The sunlight apart from itself. Darkness
And light are the same thing. Music moves
Effortlessly between the two, made of nothing
But wings, wings with eyes, no end in sight.

                    Study of Two Figures (Pasiphaë/Sado)
                ","
One figure is female, the other is male.
Both are contained.
One figure is mythical, the other historical.
To the extent that one can be said to have existed at all, they occupy different millennia, different continents.
But, to the extent that one can be said to have existed at all, both figures are considered Asian—one from Colchis, one from Korea.
To mention the Asianness of the figures creates a “racial marker” in the poem.
This means that the poem can no longer pass as a white poem, that different people can be expected to read the poem, that they can be expected to read the poem in different ways.
To mention the Asianness of the figures is also to mention, by implication, the Asianness of the poet.
Revealing a racial marker in a poem is like revealing a gun in a story or like revealing a nipple in a dance.
After such a revelation, the poem is about race, the story is about the gun, the dance is about the body of the dancer—it is no longer considered a dance at all and is subject to regulation.
Topics that have this gravitational quality of aboutness are known as “hot button” topics, such as race, violence, or sex.
“Hot button” is a marketing term, coined by Walter Kiechel III, in a September 1978 issue of Fortune magazine.
The term evokes laboratory animals and refers to consumer desires that need to be slaked.
The term “hot button” suggests not only the slaking of such desires but also a shock or punishment for having acted on those desires, a deterrent to further actions pursuing such desires, and by extension, a deterrent to desire itself.
Violence and sex are examples of desires and can be satisfied, punished, and deterred.
Race is not usually considered an example of desire.
Both the female and the male figures are able to articulate their desires with an unusual degree of candor and specificity.
Both are responsible for many sexual deaths.
The male figure says, “When anger grips me, I cannot contain myself. Only after I kill something—a person, perhaps an animal, even a chicken—can I calm down.... I am sad that Your Majesty does not love me and terrified when you criticize me. All this turns to anger.” “Your Majesty,” here, refers to the king, his father.
The female figure is never directly quoted, but Pseudo-Apollodorus writes that she casts a spell upon the king her husband so that when he has sex with another woman, he ejaculates wild creatures into the woman’s vagina, thereby killing her. Although the punishment is enacted on the body of the woman, this punishment is meant to deter the king from slaking his desires.
Both figures, royal themselves, are angry at the king, but neither attempts to kill the king—which would be political. Instead they displace this anger onto other unnamed deaths, which are considered sexual but not political.
Both figures have spouses known for strategy, for self-preservation in  politically tumultuous times, times of many unnamed deaths.
Both figures are counterfoils to their strategizing spouses, figures of excessive  desire, requiring containment.
Both containers are wooden.
Both containers are camouflaged with a soft, yielding substance—one with grass, one with fur.
Both containers are ingenious solutions to seemingly intractable problems.
One problem is political. One problem is sexual.
They are both the same problem.
They have the same solution.
The male figure waits in the container for death to come. He waits for eight days. His son will live. This ensures the succession, the frictionless transfer of power.
The female figure waits in the container for the generation of a life. We do not know how long she waits. Her son will die, after waiting in his own wooden container. This ensures the succession, the frictionless transfer of power.
There are many artistic representations of both containers.
The male figure’s container is blockish, unadorned, a household object of standard size and quotidian function. Tourists climb into it and pose for photos, post them online. The cramped position of their bodies generates a combination of horror and glee. This, in turn, creates discomfort, the recognition that horror and glee should not be combined, that such a combination is taboo.
The female figure’s container is customized, lushly contoured. Its contours are excessively articulated to the same degree that her desire is excessively articulated. Artists depict the container in cutaway view, revealing the female figure within, awaiting the wild creature. The abject position of the female figure—on all fours, pressing her genitalia back against the hollow cow’s genitalia—generates a combination of lust and revenge. This, in turn, creates discomfort—the recognition that lust and revenge should not be combined, that wild creatures and female figures should not be combined, that these combinations are taboo.
Hot button topics are taboo because they generate discomfort.
The male figure slakes his violent desires and is punished. The male figure also functions as a hot button, a means whereby the violent desires of tourists  are slaked, while generating discomfort in these tourists.
The female figure slakes her sexual desires and is punished. The female  figure also functions as a hot button, a means whereby the sexual desires of artists are slaked, while generating discomfort in these artists.
The tourist can climb into the rice chest. The tourist can pose for a photo in the rice chest. Then the tourist can climb out of the rice chest and walk away.
The artist can look into the hollow cow. The artist can render the contours of the hollow cow, the contours of the female figure. Then the artist can walk away.
Both containers allow the tourist and artist to touch the hot button, the taboo.
The desire and the discomfort remain contained.
Both containers allow the tourist and the artist to walk away.
The male and female figures remain contained.
Neither container—the rice chest, the hollow cow—appears to have any necessary connection to race.
To mention race where it is not necessary to mention race is taboo.
I have not mentioned the race of the tourist or the artist.
The tourist and the artist are allowed to pass for white.
The tourist and the artist are not contained.
I have already mentioned the race of the poet.
But to the extent that the poet is not contained, the poet is allowed to pass for white.
I have already mentioned the race of the male and female figures.
The male and female figures are contained.
The rice chest and the hollow cow are containers.
The rice chest and the hollow cow are not the only containers in this poem.
Colchis and Korea are containers in this poem.
Asianness is a container in this poem.
Race is a container in this poem.
Each of these containers contains desire and its satisfaction.
Each of these containers contains discomfort and deterrence.
Each of these containers contains a hot button, a taboo.
The tourist and the artist can enter each of these containers.
The tourist and the artist can touch the hot button and walk away.
Each of these containers separates the slaking of desire from the punishment of desire.
Each of these containers is an ingenious solution to a seemingly intractable problem.
They are the same problem.
They have the same solution.
Each of these containers ensures the frictionless transfer of power.
Each of these containers holds a male or female figure.
The name of the male figure can be translated as “Think of me in sadness.”
The name of the female figure can be translated as “I shine for all of you.”

Father Lear the king so shaped his bairns
with the wand’s upper hand
the fire’s swanny wing
smooth tippet of the spider
In the very kingdom of herbs and servants
he shaped them
from peace vessels of the animals
from toil of the flesh
from milk horses and the birds of sighed mercy
and the tongue undone
He shaped his bairns
in night’s long harm and in day’s bright psalter
in the seven courts of the north
and with the mild birch of the paternoster
From his ploughing fields and his sweat
his toothèd heart and his waxing wit
Father Lear the king shaped his bairns
for good or ill           this he did

After Cai Guo-Qiang



Quick, before the sun
rises, get up one more
time, my grandmother.
The artist won’t mind
if you borrow
his sky ladder.
Place your foot
on the bottom rung
and keep climbing,
even though
you’re a skeleton
with a broken neck
from falling downstairs
on Guy Fawkes night.
The ladder is wrapped
in gunpowder, and he’s
lit the touchpaper.
Your bones are ascending
firecrackers.
You’re half a kilometer
high now, halfway
to the universe,
my joy-gardener.
I hope you find a
garden with rich black
soil for your black
roses, hybrids like you—
half white half Indian,
half woman half flower,
their roots twined
through your skull,
you who were transplanted
among the pale roses
of a British family.
Your skin now a mix
of photons and soot.
What do you find up there?
Is there a hothouse?
Are there alien hands
with deft brushes
pollinating stars?
Remember how
your tomatoes kept
yielding more planets?
Are there constellations
of exotic fruit now
you’ve reached the top?
Have you gone back
enough in space-time
to when you were alive?
The ladder is charred,
the hot air balloon
that held it up
is about to collapse.
The explosions are over.
Cai showers his head
with champagne, as his
100-year-old granny
watches on her cell phone.Did you see it? He asks,did you hear the whoosh,
the rat-tat-tat

The fools nearly killed me trying to make me one of them:
a loaded word of  bond with dress codes and penal codes,
postured allegiant to the culture as with the flying of flags
from knots tied on the back of  head wraps worn hoods over.
I can’t gunpoint when the life of this alter ego began though
the possibility can’t be dismissed it began at gunpoint in a way,
with an icy pressure against the temple, the mind splitting into two
tracks while a circus of peers clowned.Going back far too long
now, the camera has blurred my edges in the suggestion of motion
even if  I stood as still as the air does before shit really hits the fan.
I truly went ass-first into fronting indifference, forbade my happy
teeth from public reveal lest they pop the balloon of my perfectly
round face, baby-angled, already read as kind or innocent or soft
from the jump when I wanted respect on my name and women on
my lap like it was said I should. And, shamefully, I did. Several
sistas come to mind here and this doesn’t make me feel good;
a tender touch in the moonlight goes only so far for a shadow.
I had to break it down for myself that being down represented
the fear of having fear.I still shake when the wind blows,
scary as ever, thespian as always in all ways toward the ghost
of a threat or disrespect passed through me then through me,
through a thin skin then through the skin. So, to compensate—
a mask, what Dunbar’s bars beat home way back when about
standing in the presence of the pale folks, only that idea flipped
upside down, what’d be a forced smile slicing the face open like
some summertime melon instead setting scowl folds into smooth
forehead, brown eyes set at the mouth’s corners, fixing it in the
position of silence like rusty nails.If carrying nothing else,
I learned to bring this exact look to the danger because being me
to the fullest would be a liability, provide a sharper image for the
hidden cameras to home in on; yes, just that fast—a certified blue,
strolling up to the screen door with a heavy hand for knocking and
his true hand resting so sweetly on his gun. My gun, I should say,
since in this case the cop is also me, like that little angel or devil
used as sitcom trope.Just imagine the person coming for you
being  you every time: don’t trip, you’d say, unless into the fight.

with an unfit “hello.” And later when the presents
are in stockings crowded by the chimney breast,
to remember the lead-haired fisherman I was then,
waiting a year for the prize of a red honey jar,
at a sagging table eating my eggs among ashes—
whoever does not love this does not love this life!

One of the first I learned was the trinity, three persons in one
God: father, son, and holy spirit, née ghost. Then I started writing
JMJ on all my homework and tests, for good luck, but also because
My ballpoint’s blue ink looked pretty beside the paper’s purple
Ink, like the inside of a clamshell when I teared up or squinted
From the smell. Sometimes the sheets were wet and curled like
Petals reeking of gin, which is why it was called spirit duplication,
After the nonflammable alcohol used in the process. Jesus, Mary,
And Joseph, is what the three initials meant. I’d draw a cross from
The descending caret of the M and think of Mary, the mother,
And of the other Mary, not, weeping at the limp feet of the crucified
Jesus. Where was Joseph, I wondered, but never asked. We seemed
To pity him a little, for reasons I couldn’t name, like my father,
Who was both my father and a son, and soon to be the son of
His father’s ghost. When my grandmother was dying, she asked
Her only child, my mother, to go with her. Mom waited decades
To obey, but she finally went. Together in one grave now, they are
Two Marys, maybe with the Jesus of their most solitary prayers,
Petals littering their one stone’s four corners. Being motherless,
Like being childless, is both good and bad, I think,
And it is a third thing, too, that is neither of these.

Where there’s blood, there are birds.
After the war, many of the men’s faces are missing parts: an eye, a nose, a mouth.
One doctor uses a man’s own rib to construct a new jaw.
They call him the-man-who-fixes-faces.
A body might stay whole in the trench, but who can resist looking up, sometimes, at the birds?
You get out alive, maybe, but your face wears forever the look of what’s lost.
The-man-who-fixes-faces might give you something like a face.
Now all you see are faces turning away.
A bullet wounds in a straight line, but shrapnel is feathery: it picks up dirt.
The birds, it’s easy to forget, are filthy; a little bird in the blood can kill you.
A square within a circle, the golden ratio, symmetry, they say, makes a face beautiful.
Birds have two eyes, two legs, and two wings, but the soldier’s face is half here, half in the air.
Mirrors can be psychologically damaging to birds.
Birds are territorial.
Birds keep going back to the fountain to check on that one bird beneath the water.
In the park near the hospital, the-man-who-fixes-faces paints some of the benches blue.
The blue benches are for the men whose faces are unrecognizable.
I’ve seen a bird attack a window.
If you don’t want to see a man healing, look up at the sky.
Why is the sky blue?
Symmetry: a line drawn from the sun through the zenith to the “anti-sun.”
Like shrapnel, light scatters.

home. Aba tears at his clothes & covers

the body. Says even birds died

Days before the bodies were turned

With rainwater. Float

I gave up the pencil, the walk in woods, the fog
     at dawn, a keyhole I lost an eye to.
And the habit of early, of acorn into oak—
      bent   tangled   choked because of ache or greed,
      or lousy light deemed it so.
So what. Give up that so what.
O fellow addicts of the arch and the tragic, give up
     the thousand-pound if and when too.
     Give up whatever made the bed or unmade it.
Give up the know thing that shatters into other things
     and takes the remember fork in the road.
The remember isn’t a road.
At noon, the fog has no memory of fog, the trees I walked

cannot dig down what its own brief nothing

It’s like touching without touching,
except when there is, also, touching.
We pull the bowstrings back
and parallel together,
aiming a handsbreadth higher
than we believe we intend,
and let the glove move where we draw the wire,
scared that the machinery
will misinterpret us,
that we may not stop trembling, that we may lose
our belief in ourselves
before anything is released, or shared, or sent.
And yet we trust the notch to know
the whereabouts of the bow,
and trust the tail or fletching
of each salvo to astonish
the target as soon as it gets there, to make its point
within its nest of Os and Os and Os.
Our belts and buckles try to keep the secrets
we have begun to decide
that, later, we want to expose.
There is the rest of our group, and there is the river,
and that is called the kisser, the stabilizer
on your shoulder. Do what I do. You have time.
Put your hand over my hand. That feels nice.

to participate in this activity, we have become
the elevated counselors
of the air, which will not take
anything but our most forceful advice.

                ","
Too busy peddling my fire and trying to keep the mouths fed
and packing up belongings of the recent dead right now to access
your luxurious philosophy, though one looks forward to a time
when the universe permits, I said to my electric correspondent
who came at me puffed pink in thoughtfulness when what I needed
then as now was a quiet high enough to envision a half-gallon
brick of all-natural vanilla ice cream softening on the hot hood
of an idling cop car: the earliest rivulets, a slow loss of strict
rectangularity, then the wild gliding around on the beautiful bleak
enamel paint job as its sweet fragrance fills the air like a gift
from Madagascar I can breathe. Rapt Cortés transported cuttings
of vanilla across the Atlantic during his plunder of the Aztecs;
the Aztecs themselves fell captive to its magic after vanquishing
its first cultivators the Totonacs, who paid their conquerors tributes
of baskets stacked to heaven with cured vanilla pods like long
sentences of salutiferous essence. This is one of those instances
history likes to push your face into to try to stir your appetite
for cruelty a little, or at least make you covet the perks of it: I too
want vanilla in quantity. I want it all around me, like a fortress
of mellow dangles. It will move with me as I move and it will ward
hateful people off. For centuries Europeans tried to cultivate it
outside its native Mexico and failed. They could get the vine
to flower, but in the absence of ancestral pollinators, specifically
hummingbirds and a stingless bee, the flowers dropped off podless.
Meanwhile, Edmond Albius—born into slavery on an island
east of Madagascar known then as Bourbon, lush French colony
and home to roses, one active volcano, one dormant, and one
arena-like caldera that holds the record for most rainfall shed
in one location by a single tropical cyclone ever, namely Hyacinthe—
knew enough from orchids at age twelve in 1841 to think to lift
with a bamboo splint the flap of the rostellum dividing the pollen-
heavy male anther from the female stigma in order to rub the pollen
on the stigma’s eager wand. Within weeks the pods had begun
to form and lengthen into joyous beanlike squiggles laden with
tiny seeds like secrets of the universe as Albius at the shore and under
bright southern stars breathed out I hope in a kind of enlargement
akin to liberty from time, so that on that occasion he might feel
briefly as if his own, even as his method of vanilla pollination
belonged first to his master, then Madagascar, and then the world,
with nearly all vanilla produced today as Albius taught us, including
the kind in Breyers since 1866, fourteen years before Albius died
unrecognized, in poverty, in misery to be exact, while everyone white
around him grew rich with vanilla, adding it to candy, Coca-Cola,
Chanel No. 5, and even in effigy to the air freshener dangling
down in my Uber, its waves whispering Albius, Albius, but inaudibly.

then thrusting our chins to inhale?
I loved you so much

bled out in your seat until curtain call,
blood only we saw.
As well as death, we’d mime marriage.

Only after our rings became solid
silver did they truly disappear.
Now the house is a mime scene.
Mime blood all over the floor,
trodden into carpet fibers,
shirts, bras, dried to an airy crust

my neck at the traffic lights,
pow on the train, I suspend
my non-knife above my head,

1. they were a kind of solution
Say one Spaceman, when she lands, will touch
down in a human sentence, speaking Dutch,
a dialect of Mentalese. Her torch-
songs (loosely rendered from the Arcturan): “Baby
Let’s Get Square with Pi,” or, “You’re the Apple
of My Eye,” or “Boola Theta Babel
Bye-Bye.” It might make sense. This is a heady
thought. The traditional verse, viz. “Who’s Your Daddy,”
as sung in The War of the Worlds, and signaled Mayday,mayday—a little like Beethoven’s 4th in digital
redaction—may underpin what limbic Dutch
must once upon a time have bloomed beneath the sagittal
crest of Homo—Who? What? This news just in!—the starry
sky is empty. Spacemen are out. Sorry.
2. exo-statisticians change minds, cite insufficiency of planetary bodies of right type
What, no aliens? Or, with greater dignity,life elsewhere in the universe? That window’s
shut, we learn. Astronomers, indignant
desert birds, eyes screwed to the long cinder-
scuttles of their telescopes, will voice some doubt,
one hopes! This is too lonely. Heliocentric
humility’s a habit hard to shake. Endowed
with what we’ve called “intelligence,” or “powerful
intelligence,” like-minded creatures, each an end-
point in a home-world’s evolutionary raffle,
well, just must across the vasty deeps of space
and time yearn forth to find each other with awful
big radios. That’s how the Book of Revelations
we knew used to read, rephrased so, pi be praised.
3. binary
My friend the geometer, when asked if pi
were in the sky or in the skull, replied
pi’s the pontification of a ratio.
Bisected, so, the circle: pi. To show
that in a well-formed sentence, well, that’s human, sure.
All language is. So ever since that fateful shore
of Lake Turkana where tongue forked, where first
flaking syntax split the atom into force
and mass, thing and verb, the copula
has groped to reanneal it: this opulence
is equal to the sum of those simplicities ...
So here’s the mystery: across the placid
surface of the water a salt of stars
once scattered, hissing. Caliban stammered Are
stars. Then, Look, look up at the stars!
4. prose obtrusions concerning the keats equation



Hold it there.
Would you say truth’s a property of sentences, but beauty’s not?
So that mysterious predictive gift of mathematics is precisely that of  sentences like I predict the sun will rise tomorrow?—isn’t that the leap that left the chimpanzees behind?—and adding time of sunrise just adds  increment to the precision?
So that Platonic realm where Mathematics must exist to be discovered by Ramanujan or Hardy or Arcturans tucked in anywhere in time or space is just that space where earlier equations live, like love’s a rose or tears are rain, which Hardy’s and Ramanujan’s respective ancestors discovered independently?
That if in England two men feed a horse, the horse stays thin, the axiom would hold as well for two Tibetan yaks or fat Jurassic stegosaurs (assuming less that that’s what the Arcturans use to carry mail than that, like us, they pinch their pence)—
That that’s the realm where poems and equations likewise lie unspoken,  quietly awaiting their discovery?
And so those famous instances where mathematics efflorescing on some blackboard purely for the play of it turn out to have a shocking congruence with patterns in the world is just exactly like the case where poetry is news before the news it stays?
That hadn’t the acclaimed predictive potency of mathematics best be cast as a reminder of forgotten shock—the shock our shaggy kind must once have felt, framing for the first time well-formed sentences about the world that was, and then about the world about to be, and so extended human sensibility  and thrust it forth as backward through the night of time?
Yes, if diffidently.

5. postscriptum
The aliens are back, incidentally. Astral
systems dropping planets like nuts in May. Exo-
biology leaps again into likelihood. A straw
poll proves the numbers may be multiplex.
No small relief for this slow versifier,
who, peering through this poem’s decades-long zoom-
lens has seen what changes?—sapphire
heaven bleached of all biology?—shazam!—
and then revivified, less abruptly,
with a thought. In the same blink of the clock
the pupil of a black hole was seen to matter,
some dinosaurs grew feathers, and (this one for Ripley’s)
Pluto got demoted from a planet to a rock.
Also my family died. Also I had a daughter.

Fucked art thou, with luck, o reader within the palace within the palette within the impatience within, who tilts his letters into the light of the mind’s muttering unto itself, releasing their sounds to the whirlpool fierce of an ear to draw creations in—
Who brings forth a kiss of circumference, the glyphs hooked and loosened and linking, as though they were dancing through moths of minutes and months like wind—out of a god whose name is Gone ...
Fukkit and lukky art thou in the wind moving marjoram into the mint, the fuzz and down of the former grazing the raised ribs of the other, the essences borne—
Pheromones suddenly wafting, your eye catching the gradient greens and vein-like patterns, the gray stubble of sage’s tongue, thick oregano’s glister and whorl, stalks of thyme spiking the air on a kitchen porch or Sikinos slope with its lavender flower, lit up, still, in June;
The blue film of night’s end rolling into white near dawn, the light by which you know a friend, the ancients explain, from six feet off—or, a wolf from a dog;
The glow of morning bougainvillea, its papery bracts in a breeze like prayer, its bezeled ruby beginnings morphing into pinks- and magentas-to-come, cream-tipped corollas on perfect display, style and stigma sheathing the anther;
Then creeping Christians’ dusky luster, in the shade at noon;
Almonds swelling jade drupes into the sinking summer, encoding spring’s initial explosion;
Pomegranate’s garnet, pendant, containing—against the green of its arch and stretch—six hundred seeds dark with light, glinting in its skin;
Fucked, art thou, and lucky, who translates it into the day as blessed—
So blessèd as in blasted art thou, in a way, in whom this knowing is strengthened in bringing you down to the cords of arthritic knees,  wrestling the gust of a given moment’s giving—like vapor—and  strangely grateful;
Blessèd art thou whose petitions are curses, whose fuck touches the  innermost chamber, waking the king and queen in their slumber;
Blessèd the consonants funneling vowels,
In Scripture’s offering—a dove’s neck wrung, cakes unleavened and  mingled with oil;
Blessèd the spirit’s meniscus within a letter typed or scrawled, as  not-quite-deciphered codes of soul—
A pupil’s reaching through a sentence, slipping and reaching again, and again, a teacher tracing the shape of her thinking;
Blessèd even the stink and politic rot of the day’s pronouncements on high, Liver of the blaspheming Jew, gall of goat, and slips of yew—
in action as Evil: the concrete Lego-like bunker and tower, bunker and tower, barbwired cabbage and vines, shadows gliding as crows fly across the road to the holy of hills and prefab huts, from which goat-like thugs emerge, watching and then descending through a glowering slope- stepping prance, tribal fringes trailing—their dance sick with a stiffened faith, wicking and blotching their map of state, like a cancered scan,  eating away at its language and letters, as Gone yields goon, or gun, or bone, where lips meet and part in the “b” of all that’s brutal and also insidious, pointed to and taken on, in the maybe pointless battle—
Evoking the hundred blessings the rabbis say need to be uttered daily, reading the number—me’ah (hundred)—into the word for what, or mah: “What does Becoming your God ask of you?” (Deuteronomy, 10:12);
And blessèd is never quite knowing, exactly, what those blessings should be.

For Juan Felipe Herrera



In the town of frijoles,
men eat their meals without
washing their hands, wanting
to bless their mothers’ food
with soil from the fields.
In the town of frijoles,
boys beat on hollow pots,
the last wiping of their sides
with a piece of tortilla as
holy a moment as taking
the wafer in church.
In the town of frijoles,
women undress to keep
their babies warm, stories
whispered into bald heads
revealed as poems decades
later, when it is early.
In the town of frijoles,
old men cry for their
fathers and mothers,
tombstone ranches dotting
the night moon where
the pinto aromas extend
beyond the bowl of the sun.

A crow perches inside me.
Actually, it is a whale. It is hard to tell
by touch alone. Nothing I own ever looks
me properly in the eye. Sometimes
a loud caw at dusk feels
like the largest mammal on Earth.
A deep breath out the blowhole
into my stomach. One second it swims
and the next it is a small extension
of a tree. This is a kind of beginning—
a finger puppet show. The light
dancing around my hands.
Me dancing alone on a stem.
A persimmon blooms.
A boy learns a song and plants it
in an orchard. Inside of me
the large creatures change their shapes
to fit. A blackbird. An organ.
Animals with no names. I send them off
into the world daily. Little sadness
takes flight. Love is a brave child.
These things take the shape
of their containers.
I don’t have to do anythingto hold them.

Exodus is a traffic jam,

a child’s brigade does battle
on this doomed track hourly blown to dust.
To occupy themselves, they race a tank.
Dust is faster. Tattered surveillance blimps
yank against steel tethers over the saltlick plain.
The road goes boom again. The flimsy means
by which we try to distance war
don’t matter anymore. Disguise your car,
your hair, take to the air, stare down
on the terrible mirror of the ground
where those who didn’t qualify
for tickets to the sky

in calf’s blood.” More, our son
asks, More okean, watches the red
beneath them spreading, More ocean.
“Killer whales,” the voice reminds,
the blue calf’s heart bigger
than all three of ours, its blood could fill
our son’s bathtub for weeks. The orcas
only eat the head, let the rest sink
to the ocean floor, but no, the voice
points out how body born six thousand pounds
lands on the skeleton of a full grown blue,
“Nothing gets wasted in the water.”Look, our son staring, Look,
learning how the deep devours,
blubber separates from bone,
even bone won’t survive long,
eaten by water worms and salt.
Spicy, our son calls any intense
flavor, tears in his mouth, but no,
not over this, the calf’s
blood or its bones, the orcas
swimming through reddened salt,
but over desire, he wants
what he cannot have
or doesn’t want what he is
given, a calf’s heart
in the teeth of a hungrier mammal,
because what else is worth
that much salt?

In order to see the world’s evils clearly
They redden their eyes on the branch
Until they believe the warm wind’s praise

They offer their lives to the wine cellar

Tries to send waves through my heart
It’s a jockey riding my bloodstream
Loosening age’s reins—
I used dirty words I don’t normally use
Nearly scaring awake my dead relatives
I fell fast asleep with my arms around love
And, waking, couldn’t find my lover
I fit right in at a banquet in the city
And finally realize, love is wine’s tax
High taxes make wine noble

Thinking.
Wondering if
my trot to Paris
to suffer you
wasn’t all wrong.
My amour fou
precise as a shark
collecting scents
miles off,
exact as a saint
cowed before
invisible wings
rustling
abstract sheets?
Your eyes
green, and red
your hair,
iconic in this
television universe
of one man
let nothing on,
no “real” Twitter feed
surrendering candid
portraits of what
you believe,
what you love.
And I sit, subtracted,
before my love.
Wondering.
Subjected
as I was
to plural echoesnth parts sensual,nth parts trust,
and to hear there
a call
to illegitimate Paris
where I fit
right in,
Jacques Brel songbook,
ukulele, bread
and wine, simulacralmaudit bohemian
pelted by Polanski-ish
rain, but happy
away from Los Angeles
where you fit in,
being able, in one city,
to drive for hours
and never leave home.
My choked voice grumbled
“de chrysanthèmes ...”
(Brel song) as
I sought the streets
of Apollinaire’s “Zone”
on Google maps
(which I paid dearly
for)
still hearing the
angel
even as
you were angry with me
who nearly destroyed
your apartment’s electricity
plugging in some idiotic
gadget of mine
and leaving it smoking
drunk on uke, bread and wine.
Hard not to think
this symbolic
or a great way to pep
up an episode
of Friends, or an ancient
Merchant Ivory film.
If I were Anne Carson
you’d be translation
and I
an impotent scholar
before the Greek,
drawn by love
to the undecided
omnivorous Word
that paints travelogue,
that shields Earth,
begging
this word side with me
when I touch down in Paris,
that it’s you who’d
ground this polysemous
text
with a kiss, or touch
puppyish, unambiguous.
Oh, that Anne
Carson, such a genius.
She makes
me think.
I’ve never been
so wrong, and in
the wrong place,
a foreigner, foreigned
in my own goddamned
country
by double negation
fitting right
in (as I’ve
said) and you
a Mediterranean accent
amidst the stones
of French abstraction,
pride, often cruelty,noirs désirs
circling like bats
who’ve read too much Saint-Just
and mistaken it for Sade.
(That sounds quite important.
I’m afraid it’s not.)
It rained. I wrote
a pining song
in a hotel room
refusing your offer
to stay with you
and your boyfriend
(quelle horreur)
who spoke no French
while I
conducted vertiginous conversations
with a curator
at the Musée Gustave Moreau
pinning my hopes
on words like “Gautier” (Théophile)
“Mallarmé” and “Rimbaud”
(who didn’t come up
of course),
and marred the language
even further with the help
of Google translate
in my letters to you
in the guise of, who?
it wasn’t Baudelaire
(I can’t remember who,
maybe Marat,
and you, Charlotte Corday).
I liked the pining song,
in the end,
it’s Morrissey-esque, funny
but grim, slippery
and only incomplete
without (or with) you.
Here I do not
go again,
merely think
flat-footed
on my horizon
(scratching
my itchy head, I
think I have dandruff)
while you
sleep
in a Westwood Airbnb
lyrically, so
I am drawn
shark-angelly
down Hollywood Blvd.
on the 302
to an American-styleaperitivo
with sliders instead
of funicular olives
again with you
talking,
and I gazing deep
into your colors,
reading your Tweets
but never commenting.

So I entered suffering. A room with dazzling walls, starched drapes, a bed with the coverlet turned down just so. Shirred bed skirts. The pillowcase crisp, bearing the marks of the iron. A low wrought iron table with a pitcher and its glass of water. Curtain half cinched.
Was anyone else ever here? Not a trace of a prior occupant. No candy wrapper. No smudge on the high-gloss sheen. Yet I marvel at the labor that must have gone into all those preparations: someone lifting the mattress, twice, as you must, and adding the final touches; smoothing away all traces of a final touch, filling the glass precisely, so the camber of water fits like a seal over the rim.
A radio on the nightstand. It lights up, and there’s the very voice in my mind, arguing with itself, trying to convince itself that it suffers. Why so many hypnotic cadences, so many rhetorical flourishes—anaphora, chiasmus, parataxis—such subtle case logic, Rogerian argument, appeals to so many arbiters: God, reason, justice, twilight?
Search from station to station, and the white noise in between. On fm, am, and shortwave, the same rapt monologue. That marshaling of precedent, scientific data, illustrations from the history of medicine, the Upanishads, the Vedas, the sutras and suras, the Sermon on the Mount. But what is  suffering? Is it true that it requires my consent?
In a shaft of evening, the trillion worlds collide.
The rose in the vase grows whiter in darkness.

 Exchange in greed the ungraceful signs. Thrust
The thick notes between green apple breasts.
Then the shadow of the devil descends,
The violent space cries and angel eyes,
Large and dark, retreat in innocence and in ice.
(Run sister run–the Bugga man comes!)
 
The violent space cries silently,
Like you cried wide years ago
In another space, speckled by the sun
And the leaves of a green plum tree,
And you were stung
By a red wasp and we flew home.
(Run sister run–the Bugga man comes!)
 
Well, hell, lil sis, wasps still sting.
You are all of seventeen and as alone now
In your pain as you were with the sting
On your brow.
Well, shit, lil sis, here we are:
You are I and this poem.
And what should I do? should I squat
In the dust and make strange markings on the ground?
Shall I chant a spell to drive the demon away?
(Run sister run–the Bugga man comes!)
 
In the beginning you were the Virgin Mary,
And you are the Virgin Mary now.
But somewhere between Nazareth and Bethlehem
You lost your name in the nameless void.“O Mary don’t you weep don’t you moan” 
O Mary shake your butt to the violent juke,
Absorb the demon puke and watch the white eyes pop,
(Run sister run–the Bugga man comes!)
 
And what do I do. I boil my tears in a twisted spoon
And dance like an angel on the point of a needle.
I sit counting syllables like Midas gold.
I am not bold. I cannot yet take hold of the demon
And lift his weight from you black belly,
So I grab the air and sing my song.

Your body is a box of mirrors, a mercury mine. You have blossomed and spread, white mystery of spring. All your blood and treasure is spent. O rose, you are sick. The morning rain does not nourish you. Your mouth is caught in a rigid O. Where only deficit is at home. You stand beneath a white hospital, almost drunk. You cannot say why your sense is drenched: exhaustion or debt. What’s the difference again? A braid of eyes. Curtains the color of a dove’s wing. Ceramic lips framed against seismic shatter. “Soft zone.” Meanwhile your uncle is dying in San Francisco and you do not know it. You are standing in front of another hospital whose patients are strangers. You unwind a rope of carbon so that you can post pictures of it on the internet.

It was Adolphe Sax, remember,
not Saxo Grammaticus, who gets the ovation.
And by the time he had brought all the components
together–the serpentine shape, the single reed,
the fit of the fingers,
the upward tilt of the golden bell–
it was already 1842, and one gets the feeling
that it was also very late at night.
 
There is something nocturnal about the sound,
something literally horny,
as some may have noticed on that historic date
when the first odd notes wobbled out of his studio
into the small, darkened town,
 
summoning the insomniacs (who were up
waiting for the invention of jazz) to their windows,
but leaving the sleepers undisturbed,
evening deepening and warming the waters of their dreams.
 
For this is not the valved instrument of waking,
more the smoky voice of longing and loss,
the porpoise cry of the subconscious.
No one would ever think of blowing reveille
on a tenor without irony.
The men would only lie in their metal bunks,
fingers twined behind their heads,
afloat on pools of memory and desire.
 
And when the time has come to rouse the dead,
you will not see Gabriel clipping an alto
around his numinous neck.
 
An angel playing the world’s last song
on a glistening saxophone might be enough
to lift them back into the light of earth,
but really no further.
 
Once resurrected, they would only lie down
in the long cemetery grass
or lean alone against a lugubrious yew
and let the music do the ascending–
curling snakes charmed from their baskets–
while they wait for the shrill trumpet solo,
that will blow them all to kingdom come.

For Judy Williams Fraser 



1963-69 I lived on
the corner of Yew & York
on the 2nd floor
above  a corner store
with my sister Leni  & boyfriend soon to be husband Neap  Hoover
her friend Jo-Ann Huffman & her boyfriend Mike Sawyer
then  Elsa Young  (just left Robert who was with Maxine)
who met her lover Jack Wise next door
then my sister Mary
and my boyfriend  soon to be (later to unbe) husband Cliff Andstein
below us
bill bissett & martina & oolya  then painter-jogger  Gordon Payne
& Merrilyn  (who becomes my friend later)  then bill again then Gordon again
next to us
Bing Thom, Jay Bancroft & often Marian Penner, Rick Clarke
across the landing
John and Susan Newlove & children fathered by gerry gilbert
later the Ridgeways
and next to them directly opposite us:
Gerry Geisler (New Design Gallery)
and Helen Sturdy & children
our kitchen faced theirs
apple pies in my oven & stew or toast in theirs
we cd smell everything like the time we fell asleep as pork hocks
simmered in my big red pot
charred and burned almost caught on fire
would have if Gerry hadnt woken us up
and that building a total tinderbox
always worried bill wd start one
my bedroom / study faced
the Molson’s sign and Burrard Street Bridge
and I could watch the west end and highrises and planetarium grow
and white sheets on a clothesline across the street dry
as I’d sit at my bay window
and write and mark
on a smooth board cut to fit exactly the sill
I’d glance up and see
people like  you  &  Jamie  &  Carol  &  Joan  &  Marcia  & the Trumans
and the Gadds  and the Lathams  and Lanny Beckman
walking up and down Yew Street
open the window & shout
drop by on your way back
dropping by
everybody did it
days filled with coffee, tea, poetry, cigarette smoke
crises, trips, talkedy talk talk
painting hard edged  strong coloured
also  intricate silver point mandalas
and collages
a gallon of Calogna Red
one summery Saturday night
became a party
of 100 or even more
dancing in my bedroom to one music on a tape recorder
dancing in the other to another
drumming in the kitchen
talking in the room with the blue-tile fireplace
so many bodies I couldnt hear the music
from  inside the  hallway
just saw the taller heads
moving together to different beats
in almost darkness
that crazy night at the Wahs’ place
if that wasnt a party of this kind
everybody landing on that bed
everybody kissing everybody
we had to go outside to pee
because the lineup for the can so long
somehow to do with that small space
that it was so tight that everybody had to rub every
body simply to go anywhere
It was gorgeous
after the Vancouver Poetry Conference (1963)
Roy Kiyooka started
dropping by   when he left his studio
there’d always be a light on
somewhere in our building
and he could visit  any of us
separately or clustered
one time
he told me he had a painting he wanted to give me
but it was big and heavy
he borrowed a truck and someone helped him
up the dusty always dirty long stairs
with Hoarfrost
which we hung on a wall in a room just big enough to hold
my round oak table
(used to be Bowerings’ they bought a whole household of furniture for $80 and
when they moved they gave it to Joan and then when she moved she stored it
with me)
a wall that later Elsa and I tore apart with a screwdriver and hammer
shouting angry hexes at Robert all the way
after and during that conference--
Olson, Creeley, Duncan, Levertov, Avison, Whalen, Ginsberg--
Roy and I became friends
and there were readings in my room
every second Sunday
red cast iron pot full of bean soup, corn chowder, spicey meatball vegetable stew
simmering and then cheese scones in the oven
people would come and read their new work one week
and the next week there’d be a Tish meeting
with Daphne Marlatt, Dan MacLeod, Pete Auxier, David Cull & David Dawson
rent $60 a month didnt change
and some years it was cold
the wind so cold on side facing the North Shore
that Hydro was $60 per month
and that wall frozen behind my pillows
the police were something else
they felt they had a right to question anybody so
Cliff would be up at the laundromat on 4th or
at Jackson’s to get some hamburger and be walking back with an
economics book in one hand and meat wrapped in brown paper in the other
and they’d stop him and ask him what he was doing and my friend Ray Wargo
would get stopped almost every second time he’d drop in to visit
where are you going and why and how long will you be
someone was always getting busted
someone was always tripping out
someone was always visiting from   or going to  Europe or Japan
here is a journal entry on June 9:
evening of the first ever national leaders debate on TV
“I am looking forward to seeing Trudeau--hope he gets pushed into/onto
answering more directly than he has in the past. I, like many others including
every gay man I know, do have a crush on him: he has much more style than
any Canadian politician so far. I mean style in the true sense of the word, it is
him, not affected… Cliff, of course, doesn’t trust him at all and thinks he’s a sell-
out. I don’t go that far, yet. But I do think that compromising is the only way a
politician can work this country and I do not like all the PR, razzmatazz,
fundraising, and allegiances that go into just getting elected: our system seems
to be based on gullibility…”
coming home at night up Yew Street
whether from downtown or the beach or Paul the butcher’s or Elsie the baker’s
I loved looking up at my North-facing windows
goldy  gold  mesh curtains
light filtering through
so warm  and so inviting

Not woven by innocent hands

I am forced to sleepwalk much of the time.
We hold on to these old ways, are troubled
sometimes and then the geyser goes away,
time gutted. In and of itself there is
no great roar, force pitted against force that
makes up in time what it loses in speed.
The waterfalls, the canyon, a royal I-told-you-so
comes back to greet us at the beginning.
How was your trip? Oh I didn’t last
you see, folded over like the margin
of a dream of the thing-in-itself. Well, and
what have we come to? A paper-thin past,
just so, and ‘tis pity. We regurgitate
old anthems and what has come to pass, and why
dwell on these. Why make things more difficult
than they already are? Because if it’s boring
in a different way, that’ll be interesting too.
That’s what I say.
 
That rascal, he jumped over the fence.
I’m wiping my pince-nez now. Did you ever hear from
the one who said he’d be back once it was over,
who eluded me even in my sleep? That was a particularly
promising time, we thought. Now the sun’s out
and it’s raining again. Just like a day from
the compendium. I’ll vouch for you,
and we can go on scrolling as though nothing had risen,
the horizon forest looks back at us. The preacher
shook his head, the evangelist balanced two spools
at the end of his little makeshift rope. We’d gone too far.
We’d have to come back in a day or so.

after Tafisha Edwards



To disappear Black girls at a low volume of sustained public panic is to insinuate the inconstancy of Black girls. The disposability of Black girls who are prone to disappearance. A body bag somewhere waits with little hoopla about its lot. Absence becomes the lot of Black girls.
 
_________ will eventually accept as fact that absence becomes a lot of Black girls. In what becomes the normal day-to-day, Black girls are harder to find, _________ would think first, not that there are few attempts to find them. The question isn’t whether Black girls often go missing. If no one else, Black girls miss each other.
 
_________  would be remiss to not recognize how everything is made less in the absence of Black girls, if _________ could miss what _________ have never been required to recognize, such as:
 
Unlike missing Black girls, taking Black girls is a Western custom. It seems likely that such a statement will soon appear inaccurate: the white space in new textbook editions will have nothing to say about it, if the white spaces behind those textbooks have anything to say about it. That Black girls are quintessential American palimpsests is not a question but an anxiety. _________ would rather forget that Black girls were made receptacles for what the authors of Liberty and Independence would not speak. That Liberty and Independence were imaginable only in the absent-presence of taken Black girls, enslaved Black girls, Black girls on whom a foundational economic system so depended that white men would kill each other and take taken Black girls.
 
The constancy of Black girls is someone’s anxiety. The soil is thick with hidden Black girls, the myth that only quiet Black girls are worthwhile Black girls. The soil turns as _________  turn away from loud Black girls and their cacophonic insistence on Black girls.
 
_________ have not insisted enough upon the fact of Black girls, are often loudly shocked to find Black girls disappeared. Loud, unsustainable shock has a way of disappearing Black girls. Outrage, too, has a way of being disappeared.

The first step is to stop just beyond the weight of organs.
The sense of gravity sitting in tissue is like the space between
carcass and curb, before the reek worms into rock pores:
a sleeplessness there, that continual niche-trash. You too
 
once knew what it was to feel impressive. As the bed dissolves
into the walls, the walls disrobe themselves of their edges
and your resolve is now acute in the locking jaw of darkness.
Beg to be let. You, like bravery, leave behind the breath-inflated
 
lump, its depths, and its refusal to lace the cells of scars over even
the metaphorical guttings. To manage the act exceeds the box-
and-whisker of lately’s along-going. You’ve grown so accustomed
to mereness that what you call a life no longer houses the sublime.
 
It seems easy to leave. It seems this easy to leave. After
a second you’ll want to consider the centimeters of resistance
stitching air between here and all of elsewhere. But, still,
inhabit the bodiless second. To possess it is a bearable joy.

Let her pray. Let them eat. Let the reverend’s

the insulin faithfully not far, and let the deep
red pinpoint puddle its urgency on a pricked
fingertip. Let the nurse find the vein the first time.
 
Let the kerosene flow and let my grandma praise
her bedside lord for letting her miss another winter.
Let me be just a little bit bitter so I remember:
Your columns and borders aint but the fractured,
the broke clean, the brownest gouges in the blades
of our great-great-great-shoulders. Let me leave
and come back when my chest opens for you wider
than your ditches did to engorge my placeless body.
 
The mosquito-thick breath in your throat coats my skin
and it almost feels as if you love me. Let the AC
drown out the TV. Let the lotion bottle keep a secret
corner til Friday. Let Ike, Wan, D-Block, all my brother’s
brothers ride through the weekend. Let the cop car
swerve its nose into night and not see none of them.
Let us smell rain. Let the breeze through an oak hymn

unwind while hushpuppy steam slips out the knot
of a tourist’s hand, and let him hear in it legends
of how hot grease kept the hounds and the lash at bay.

Strange to remember a visit, really not so
Long ago, which now seems, finally, past.   Always, it’s a
Kind of obvious thing I guess, amazed by that
Cycle: that first you anticipate a thing & it seems
Far off, the distance has a weight you can feel
Hanging on you, & then it’s there – that
Point – whatever – which, now, while
It’s happening seems to be constantly slipping away,
“Like the sand through your fingers in an old movie,” until
You can only look back on it, & yet you’re still there, staring
At your thoughts in the window of the fire you find yourself before.
We’ve gone over this a thousand times: & here again, combing that
Same section of beach or inseam for that – I’m no
Longer sure when or exactly where – “& yet” the peering,
Unrewarding as it is, in terms of tangible results,
Seems so necessary.
 
Hope, which is, after all, no more than a splint of thought
Projected outwards, “looking to catch” somewhere –
What can I say here? – that the ease or
Difficulty of such memories doesn’t preclude
“That harsher necessity” of going on always in
A new place, under different circumstances:
& yet we don’t seem to have changed, it’s
As if these years that have gone by are
All a matter of record, “but if the real
Facts were known” we were still reeling from
What seems to have just happened, but which,
“By the accountant’s keeping” occurred years.
Ago.   Years ago.   It hardly seems possible,
So little, really, has happened.
 
We shore ourselves hour by hour
In anticipation that soon there will be
Nothing to do.   “Pack a sandwich
& let’s eat later.”   And of course,
The anticipation is quite appropriate, accounting,
For the most part, for whatever activity
We do manage.    Eternally buzzing over the time,
Unable to live in it…
 
“Maybe if we go upaways we can get a better
View.”   But, of course, in that sense, views don’t
Improve.   “In the present moment” (if we could only see
It, which is to say, to begin with, stop looking with
Such anticipation) what is enfolding before us puts to
Rest any necessity for “progression”.
 
So, more of these tracings, as if by some magic
Of the phonetic properties of these squiggles…   Or
Does that only mystify the “power” of “presence"" which
Is, as well, a sort of postponement.

The tide pool crumples like a woman

bleeding onto whatever touches her.
 
The ocean, I mean, not a woman, filled

How to understand, then, what deserves rescue

Who.

I might ask you to imagine a young girl,
no older than ten but also no younger,
on a field trip to a rescue. Can you 
 see her? She is lead to the gates that separate
the wounded sea lions from their home and the class.
How the girl wishes this measure of salvation for herself:
 
to claim her own barking voice, to revel
in her own scent and sleek brown body, her fingers
woven into the cyclone fence.

I hate the word, and I guess that’s why it is said?
People love to hurt one another.
It is what makes us human.
I do love dogs.
They don’t seem to be evil unless humans make them that way.
Dogs can maul and they can sniff out bombs.
They’ll get as close to you as they can while you’re sleeping.
They’ll share heat and scent in the crook of your knees.
Is there really a thing such as innocence?
I have desired from birth to live.
Daily, I wrestle the tight arms of guilt.
At the shelter, the adoption coach told us that our new dog was highly food motivated.
I have been called a bitch.
Our dog trembles when he’s afraid and the only thing we can do is wait for the fear to leave.
There’s no comforting him.
In a dream they held me down, scrawled BITCH across my chest in old embers.
They covered my head as a weapon was raised.
I had a dog who once kept me from walking into the arroyo.
She blocked my path and wouldn’t move.

It will be windy for a while until it isn’t. The waves will shoal. A red-legged
cormorant will trace her double along glassy water, forgetting they are hungry.
The sea will play this motif over and over, but there will be no preparing for it
otherwise. Water will quiver in driftwood. Sound preceding absence,
a white dog trailing a smaller one: ghost and noon shadow, two motes
disappearing into surf. And when the low tide comes lapping and clear, the curled
fronds of seaweed will furl and splay, their algal sisters brushing strands
against sands where littleneck clams feed underwater. Light rain will fall
and one cannot help but lean into the uncertainty of the sea. Bow: a knot
of two loops, two loose ends, our bodies on either side of this shore where we
will dip our hands to feel what can’t be seen. Horseshoe crabs whose blue
blood rich in copper will reach for cover, hinged between clouds and
sea. It will never be enough, the bull kelp like a whip coiling in tender hands,
hands who know to take or be taken, but take nothing with them: I will marry you.
I will marry you. So we can owe what we own to every beautiful thing.

Will haul this gelatinous body, will lash forward this non-form, will push this organism of gas through the gray regions.
 
A sour wind tears through the thin white hair. A wind of vinegar and henbane tears in the rustling, discarded bird-shells that were abandoned empty and fragile when the throbbing bird-boils moved on toward so-called life. Now I see the cunning needle-trees sling these clumps of heavy pouch-flesh back and forth between them: small feather-birds “fly” above my heads.
 
I haul myself, I haul myself, I haul my dragging structure along the river furrow’s muddy, sloppily overlapping slopes. I am so bitter, so wet, so the mouth smears the inside with the sweetness of the chewed-up blood-chisel. Out of this blood I am going to suck my nourishment for some time.
 
I haul, I urge my dissolved substance, slowly forward across the metal of calm stones, the hovering thread-glue’s suction toward a point in the distant middle of the perspective. Where the river’s banks will meet and like the thinnest needle of silver of liquid will drill its dark tunnel-water straight into the heart of the dying image, this moistly broken-up surface of paper to which we cling.
 
I haul I haul I touch myself, touch the skin-rind with chafed-up viscous fingers. Little mermaid from ocean foam molded–I haul my long veils, layers of elastic cartilage, of slippery, shimmering membranes, chlorophyll. The gills shudder and glow deep down in this chasm of tissue–constantly rustling, squeaking, gasping for air. This whirling, howling, desperate lack of oxygen; the scream–if it had had enough oxygen to scream and a mouth with which to scream–the scream to swallow the entire lung full of clear wind.
 
Lizards play, glitter green, blue, and red between the skin membranes of the body dress. Where does this mass end? I search inward through strata to find the core of my plasma wet from juices, to find the core of body-flesh despite the outer, surrounding flesh, the naked body’s stable surface, a kind of human here inside the bluing, plant-becoming. Something to hold on to behind the spread of the sickness of mud, fermentation. But there is nothing to grasp beneath this mantle of slippery webbed skin, burst through by a pounding net of veins.
 
I now lick my tongue against the outer claws of the fingers to tear life into the ions, to make sores bitter in the tongue’s blue ventricles. A kind of pain therefore radiates against the inner glands, a faint spasm of cheers before this, the nervous system’s last chance to communicate with the dying I. The mists smart, shimmer, the lumps of blue cobalt from the mustard gas corrode through the otherwise red shroud-clouds that drag their bellies against the river’s surface. In one of the skin-folds between the pockets of the genital dress, lizards gather in heaps of glimmering scales.
 
But time runs on time and starvation and the weakness carries me in across the gray regions. And the soul’s dark night will slowly be lowered through me. That is why I now slowly fold myself like a muscle against the wet clay to press the flesh against the sleep-gland’s mouths. I will sleep now in my bird body in the down, and a bitter star will radiate eternally above the glowing face’s watercourse.

Up on the roof, waiting for the fireworks to begin
in warm winter rain, a moment ago I stepped
from the elevator into the black air
of an almost New Year
and need a minute to catch my breath
at the spread of city open to my eye.
I can't go to the edge; I never could.
The old fear of height still troubles me,
the sensation that nothing can be under me
if I am surrounded by mist and rain
and all of the dark night air we breathe.
Even a glimpse at the treetops in the park,
with its slick crisscrossing roads that plunge
into the jumbled panorama of East Side Manhattan,
hysterical tonight with its own incandescence,
gives me the willies. I feel as if
I were standing on the deck of a showboat of a cloud
as it drifts down some dark river, waiting for it
to bang into some other building's fifteenth floor.
How can these old people hunch the railing,
hoisting their plastic glasses of champagne
from under dripping umbrellas, as if
they drank the rain as they laugh
their analyses of the weather?
Maybe now, like me, they have nothing to lose.
I moved in three weeks ago; this is my first trip
to the roof. I don't want to die tonight,
the first fatality of 1990! There's too much of me
I left in pieces last year, oh, the whole last decade:
But I'm up here to distract myself, temporarily,
from what I don't want or can't have
in the way of love. . . . That must be
the Triborough Bridge, tied in its strings
of blue lights, and I can see in Central Park
the skating rink, like a scoured mirror below,
where some madman waves a red lantern; he
must be drunk. I have only sipped a speck of Drambuie,
which I didn't carry in my Coca-Cola glass
up to these festivities. This is the first New Year's
I've spent alone in twenty, twenty-two years.
I never could go to the edge; but I did.
Out there in the dark: my marriage, the woman
I loved badly, as she did me, or none too well;
the places we lived; the apartment I once half-owned;
the thousands of books I had to leave behind
(though I am to be granted library privileges)
and the black and white cat I really miss.
My wife's with her friends tonight somewhere in Brooklyn;
friends of mine out there, too, though I don't know
where. It's just like me to move in the middle
of a telephone company strike. Thus, no calls
from anyone—and I don't even have
a telephone yet, so who could call? Damp but trying
to smile, I eye the revelers. Two young men
and their enormous girlfriends have joined us,
really large women who carry balloons, all ready
to froth in merry champagne. We check
our watches to the screams from swarms
of apartment windows to the west
as the sky lights up with the first furious
bombardment of colored shells. I can see that
red lantern swinging toward the rockets—aha!
So it wasn't a drunk, but the fireworks engineer
preparing to blow the year's last sky
to smithereens for our delight!
I like to follow the tiny spurts of flame
from the launching pad in their heavenward trajectory
as much as I like the rockets' red glare,
the bombs bursting in air, which give proof
to the night that I am still here, hands
jammed in the pockets of my sodden raincoat,
face dripping with rain, hat soaked, wondering
if the skinny guy in the army jacket behind me
(who looks just like I did in the sixties)
is mumbling his way into a combat flashback
and ready to hurl me over the edge of the roof
and into kingdom come. I guess not yet. We've
survived the first blasts of spinning green,
corkscrews of spangled flame, buds of fireballs
spewed in arching gold sprays, the whistling fire-fish
that curl and howl as they flare, falling to ash.
Screaming its head off, the New York New Year enters.
I feel sad that beautiful things must die,
even shadows made of smoke and flame,
whatever I thought I had made out of my life—
music, poems, books, kisses, a little useless fame.
The army guy behind me grumbles at the haze
of rocket smoke that coils around the trees,
then tumbles up into the air toward Harlem.
That bump and thud and bump sound everywhere,
more clouds smacking each other head-on.
The flashes of the explosions are close enough
to touch if you wanted to burn your fingers
on the sky, and the glare rocks our shadows back
against the brick, as if chaos snapped
our pictures in the dark. I smile for my portrait,
curious at the New Year, smelling the acrid smoke
of the one we've just destroyed. Then I squeeze into
the tiny elevator car with the others, anonymous,
reconciled to be so, back to my little apartment
and the waiting glass of amber drink I'll raise,
only half in jest, to my new life.

For Rebecca Feldman and Brian Roessler



That's what the first line says
of the song I've been playing all summer
at the keyboard—trying to get my hands
around its dark, melancholy chords,
its story line of a melody that twists
up like snakes from melodic minor scales
that I've also been trying to learn, though
I'm no great shakes as a practicer of scales.
Come to think of it, neither am I much
when it comes to love—no great shakes, I mean.
Not that I haven't had my chances.
Twenty years married, I made a lousy husband,
half asleep, selfish, more like a big baby
than a grown man, the poet laureate
of the self-induced coma when it came to
doing anything for anybody but me.
""Now and then he took his thumb
out of his mouth to write an ode to
or a haiku about the thumb he sucked all day.""
That's what I imagined my ex-wife said
to our therapist near the end. She did say:
""It's all about Bill."" She was right.
And suddenly it frightens me, remembering
how, at our wedding, our poet friends
read poems of (mostly) utter depression
to salute us. I wondered if their griefs in love
had double-crossed our union, if strange
snakes in the grass of our blissful Eden
had hissed at us, and now I worry,
on your wedding day, if I'm not
doing the same damned thing . . . .
I haven't come to spring up and put my curse
on your bliss. Here's what I want to say:
You're young. You don’t know what love is.
And as the next line of the song goes, you won't
—""Until you know the meaning of the blues.""
Darlings, the blues will come (though not
often, I hope) to raise their fiery swords
against your paradise. A little of that
you unwittingly got today, when it rained
and you couldn't be married outside under
the beautiful tree in Nan and Alan's yard.
But paradise doesn't have to be structured
so that we can never reenter it. After
you've kicked each other out of it
once or twice (I'm speaking metaphorically,
of course), teach yourself how to say
a few kind words to each other.
Don't stand there angry, stony.
Each of you let the other know
what you are feeling and thinking
and then it may be possible
to return to each other smiling,
hand in hand. For arm in arm,
you are your best Eden. Remember
the advice the old poet sang to you
on the afternoon of August 4, 2001,
the day you got married.
May you enjoy a good laugh
thinking of him and his silver thumb
now that you've turned the key
into your new life in the beautiful
Massachusetts rain and—hey, now—sun!

                    Where X Marks the Spot
                ","
Not long after you had told me, gently,
that you still grieved for your last love,
though that had ended almost a year before,
and that you could have no intimate relationship
with me, maybe not with anyone for a time,
I stopped my fork in the air with whatever hung
on the end of it that I was eating.
My throat wouldn't swallow.
I felt weak and sick, as if it were myself
that I devoured, piece by piece, as you talked away
the hopes that I had put in your lovely face.
It was the old story coming true for me once more,
though you were hardly mine. . . .
When we finished I walked you back to your car;
I don't remember having much to say.
Why would I? Buildings drifted by,
and cars, and faces. Then we arrived at the place
where, afterwards, I would never see you again,
at a parking lot near Times Square.
There I marked the sidewalk with X's
visible only to me: ""At this place
I was lost again,"" they'd say to me
when I walked there in the future.
""Dig here and find what's left of me,
or what I left behind, where X marks the spot.""
I felt like the death's-head and crossed bones
that surmount the treasure chest.
I only felt a little like gold coins and jewels.
I have signed the City with these sphinxes
—in parks, in streets, in bedrooms,
in my own apartments. And there we stood,
you and I, hemmed in by the stitches of X's
that could not hold you to me. But X's
mean kisses, I realized, as well as
what is lost: all the kisses I couldn't give you
chalked like symbols on the sidewalk.
After all, you yourself had been marked
by loss, even in your laughter that afternoon
at the show I had taken you to. Bright-eyed
and smiling in the seat beside me, you
stole my glances with your dark, dark eyes
and your long hair. I thought that I had not been
this happy in a long time with a woman
and was ready to become even more happy,
ready to do anything that you wanted
in order to please you, to see that smile come up,
not knowing what you were soon to say to me
as we dined. And when you spoke,
I felt life fall away from me. Again I felt
that I would never be happy. I felt the words
that I had wanted to say to you leaving me, rushing
out of my chest like dead air, until I had no more words
to say. I seemed to cut and swallow my food
as if it were me myself that stuck in pieces
on the end of the fork I had raised to my mouth.
Had I been chewing on my own flesh?
Self-Pity the Devourer took me by the hand
that held the fork, and once again I feasted
on all that was dark and hopeless in myself,
in lieu of all that was beautiful, desirable,
and unattainable in you. And then
I stood beside you in the lot where you
had parked your car, with the X's buzzing
in the air, sticking themselves to you
and me and the blacktop and the cars.
When you reached out to embrace me, I
moved to embrace you in return—and then came
the part that I don't want to remember,
the part I hate: I caught a glimpse of your
face as we put our arms around each other,
and your face said everything to me about
how you had wasted the afternoon, how eager
you were to speed away in your car, a mixture
of disgust and relief that the thing would soon
be over, that I would be crossed out forever
from your life—and everything that I hated
about myself, my stupid chin, my ugly nose,
my hopeless balded head, my stuck-out ears,
my wreck of a heart, crashed over me,
spinning me into the vortex of a palpable self-hate
that I have only ever let myself feel
a little bit at a time, though it is always there

Like guns and cars, cameras
are fantasy-machines whose use is addictive.
—Susan Sontag

 



I place a photograph of my uncle on my computer desktop, which means I learn to ignore it. He stands by a tank, helmet tilting to his right, bootlaces tightened as if stitching together a wound. Alive the hand brings up a cigarette we won't see him taste. Last night I smoked one on the steps outside my barn apartment. A promise I broke myself. He promised himself he wouldn't and did. I smell my fingers and I am smelling his. Hands of smoke and gunpowder. Hands that promised they wouldn't, but did. 
This album is a stop-loss. By a dim lantern
or in the latrine
he flips through it.
He looks at himself
looking nearly as he does—
closest to himself then
as he could be, just learning
how to lean into his new body.
He suspends there
by standing order,
a spreading fire in his chest,
his groin. He is on stage
for us to see him, see him?
He stands in the noontime sun.
 
A young soldier (pictured above) the son of an imam, brother to six, is among the latest casualties in the military campaign of Susangerd. 
 
your whole body in a photo your whole body sitting on a crate pressing your eyesocket to the viewfinder of a bazooka crouched as you balance the metal tube on your shoulder in one you guide a belt of ammo into the untiring weapon proud your elbow out as if mid-waltz your frame strong and lightly supporting the gun a kind of smile ruining the picture 
You’re posing. You’re scared.
A body falls
and you learn to step over
a loosened head. You begin to appreciate
the heft of your boot soles,
how they propel you,
how they can kick in
a face–
the collapse
of a canopy bed
in an aerial bombardment,
mosquito netting doused
in napalm–cheekbones fragile
as moth wings beneath the heel.
You tighten your laces
until they hold together
a capable man.
Whatever rains,
the weight of your feet
swings you forward,
goose-stepping pendulums
a body less and less yours–
a body, God knows,
is not what makes you
anyway. So the hands
that said they never would
begin finding
grenade pins around their fingers,
begin flipping through this album
with soot under their nails
you were not ready
But they issued the shovel and the rifle and you dug
But to watch you sitting there between the sandbags
But to watch the sand spilling out the bullet holes
But what did they expect
But what did they really think a sheet of metal could prevent
But I sat rolling little ears of pasta off my thumb like helmets
But it was not a table of fallen men
But my hand registered fatigue
But the men in fatigues were tired of sleeping in shifts
But you snuck into town and dialed home until you wrote your fingers
       were tired
But the code for Shiraz was down
But all of Shiraz was down
But the sheet lightning above the Ferris wheel of rusted bolts
But I am sure they are alright you wrote Well to reassure yourself
But the wind like an old mouth shaking the unnamed evergreen outside
       my window
But what I mean is I'd like very much to talk a bitHello
 
 Operation Ramadan was an offensive in the Iran-Iraq War. It was launched by Iran in July 1982 near Basra and featured the use of human wave attacks in one of the largest land battles since World War II. Aftermath: The operation was the first of many disastrous offensives which cost thousands of lives on both sides. This one in general boosted the casualty limit up to 80,000 killed, 200,000 wounded, and 45,000 captured. In retrospect, the Iranians lacked effective command and control, air support, and logistics to sustain an attack in the first place. Saddam Hussein offered several ceasefire attempts in the following year, none of which were accepted by the Revolutionary regime. [6] [dead link]

caught in memory's half-light.

Rain pours into every room

There is big excitement in C block today.
On the window sill,
in a plastic ice cream cup
a little plant is growing.
This is all the men want to talk about:
how an apple seed germinated
in a crack of damp concrete;
how they tore open tea bags
to collect the leaves, leached them
in water, then laid the sprout onto the bed
made of Lipton. How this finger of spring
dug one delicate root down
into the dark fannings and now
two small sleeves of green
are pushing out from the emerging tip.
The men are tipsy with this miracle.
Each morning, one by one,
they go to the window and check
the progress of the struggling plant.
All through the day they return
to stand over the seedling
and whisper.

The door to the past is a strange door. It swings open and things pass through it, but they pass in one direction only. No man can return across that threshold, though he can look down still and see the green light waver in the weeds.
          Loren Eiseley
A door opens in the wilderness.
People cross through it—bloused women families
 
Acquaintances friends all the ones I have loved
Sleep-walkers night-walkers each dazed and shorn—
 
Street aurous with ice, a snowfall scratched into
Moons—and everything I’d known—
 
Inside the bleak floating light of my lungs
In the capillaries of my eyes a blood
 
Glancing through the hatches—
If I said I would always be grateful
 
If I lied or touched with spite
If night is just a foamline of shadows
 
Though we were both lost—the door
Opening—the fear of being shown
 
Whole to the one who must love you still—
And stopped as if on a walk to say
 Look at that and what matters what really counts 
And I’ll tell you everything if you promise I promise
 
I stood at door and behind me heard
Snow-plows scrape against roads
 
At the center of night—unknown to yourself 
And the word I said out-loud to no one
 
That meant it was all to no purpose 
The word for the desire inside destruction 
 
For everything that can never be brought back—
Loose snow blown hard to each bank
 
And the common reel of those who
To avoid one extreme rush toward its opposite—
 
Snow blasted to piles—and never opened up to
Anything that could reach me until you reached me—
 
Which hours belonged to us
When was I unknowingly alone
 
Why did you always return to walk here a path
Behind my closed eyes shedding salt
 
Dry snowfall and sticks—still were you here
With me I might say The moon rose in the casement window 
 The red-haired boy across the street has learned to ride his bike
There are still picnics there are fountains
 
And the world I am leaving behind saysOne learns to see one learns to be kind—
 
I closed my eyes I closed my hands
I shut down the fields in my arms
 
The cattle on the plains veins ditches
Blue ravines a gray bird
 
Sailing through a poplar brake kids
Throwing snow I closed the last swinging juncos
 
Sheep wool caught on barbed wire I closed
Fumes and clear patches of sky I seized
 
The river the town I shut down
The hard muscles of sleep farmlands
 
Warming under midnight salt-lights scruff-pines
On the ridge animals scattering across slopes I closed
 
The smooth bone of evening a storm
On the hills white and noiseless spindled
 
Prairies where I was born I shut I seized
The clouds I closed in anger—fervor—ardor

Everything you thought you knew
must be relearned overnight.
 
How to walk.
Walk, not trip, over cords, 2x4s,
used coffee cups, concrete cores.
Walk, 40 pounds on your shoulder, across
rebar or a wood plank; glide,
not wobble, not look like the bounce
beneath each bootstep scares you.
 
How to dress yourself
to work outdoors all day midwinter
and keep warm, keep working, fingers moving;
or midsummer, with no hint of breasts.
 
How to climb ladders–
not a stepstool or a 4-footer–
ladders that stretch up two stories
where someone’s impatient
for that bundle of pipe.
 
How to get coffee–
hot and how they like it–to a crew
spread out 10 floors; to carry muffins
three blocks in a paper sack
through sheets of rain.
 
How to look.
To never go back empty-handed
when you’re told, Grab me a This/Thatfrom the gangbox, if all you’ve done
is move things around, poke here and there;
if you haven’t emptied out the full contents
so the journeyman won’t shame you
by finding This/That in a quick minute,
after you’ve said, We don’t have any. 
 
How to be dependable
but not predictable-provokable.
Not the lunch break entertainment.
 
How to read
blueprints,
delivery orders,
the mood on the job;
how long it’s okay to sit down for coffee;
how early you can start rolling up cords.
 
How to do well in school
from the back row
of a seats-assigned-Jim-Crow classroom
How to learn tricks-of-the-trade
from someone who does not like you.
 
How to listen, to act-don’t-ask.
To duck when someone motions, Duck! 
Or when someone tells you, Don’t talk to Zeke,
to know what they mean
so you don’t even look
at Zeke, the ironworker who’s always first out,
last in, standing there, so four times a day–
start, lunch, quit–all the workers walk past him,
like a sandbar, waves washing back and forth,
that catches debris.
 
How to pick up the phone and call your friend,
the only one of the women not at class
the night the apprenticeship director met you all
at the door
carrying the nervous rumor
that one of the women had been raped
and you all look at each other
and it wasn’t any of you five.
 
How to respond–within protocol–
when someone takes your ladder or tools,
imitates your voices on the loudspeaker,
spraypaints Cunt on your Baker staging,
urinates in your hardhat,
drives to your home
where you live alone
with your daughter
and keys your truck parked
in your own driveway.
 
Later, you’ll need the advanced skills:
how–without dislodging the keystone–
to humiliate a person, how to threaten
a person. Deftly.
So no one’s certain for absolute
that’s what happened. Not even you.

the exosphere,
a desk where the bluest air
thins to a lip. Impossible
to know the difference
from where I sit and space.
I promise I still dream
of coming back to you, settling
on your yellow for the kitchen.
We won’t fight. Let it not manifest.
Not over the crumpled bodies
of laundry. Let us not row
over the nail polish, its color,
the spilled sun. Inspiration
is the deadliest radiation.
It never completely leaves the bones.
You know.From here,
there are no obstructions
but the radiant nothingness. An aurora
borealis opens
like a fish. This. To the pyramids, yes,
to a great wall. And there you are,
moving from curtain to curtain. O, to fantasize
of having chosen
some design with you.
But the moons over Jupiter. But
asteroids like gods
deadened by the weight of waiting. I remember
you said pastel
for the cabinet where the spice
rack lives. That I ought’ve picked you
up flowers when I had a chance. Daisy, iris, sun.
Red roses. Ultraviolet,
the color of love
(what else but this startles the air open
like an egg?).
I’m really trying
to be better, to commit
to memory the old songs about the ground,
to better sense your latitudes,
see the corona of your face.
Take your light
as it arrives. Earth is heavenly
too. But know that time is precious
here. How wine waits years and years to peak.
What is there to do: I’ve made love
to satellites in your name.
I’m saying I can’t say
when I’ll return. Remember me, for here are
dragons and the noble songs of sirens.
Stars that sway
elysian. Ships that will not moor, lovers
who are filled with blood and nothing
more. Who could love you
like this? Who else will sew you in the stars?
Who better knows your gravity and goes
otherwise, to catastrophe?
I’ve schemed and promised
to bring you back a ring
from Saturn. But a week passes, or doesn’t
manage. Everything steers impossible
against the boundless curb of light.
Believe I tried
for you. Against space. Time
takes almost everything
away. To you. For you.
A toast to the incredible. I almost wish
I’d never seen the sky
when always there was you. Sincerely,

Acts of love have
material effects. For a woman
tending the sacred fire, these include
the risk of becoming
an extinguisher
of flames essential
to civic life. It is a burden
to put out
what others hold as central
to faith in coherence. Acts of faith
have material effects — a Vestal
Virgin touched by encounter
must be buried alive,
a beautiful metaphor
for shame itself, which squirms
even under all that dirt. Thus, the dead
learn too late
that devotion should be
unidirectional, a straight line
from here to suffocation. Love must not
bleed at the edges, must not meet
others in the banal spaces
of civic life. It is a burden
to personify. If Vesta’s hearth is the site
of the sacred, its material effects
are destruction: burning, consumption,
constant hunger
for more wood. Acts
of destruction have
fantasmatic effects. For a body
surviving encounter, these include
civic life, shame;
the risk of being
a proxy — tender
of the hearth belonging
to the public, by way
of the goddess, who embodies a dream
of faith in coherence. Material effects
extinguish themselves, eventually,
as when a woman
touched in the correct way
undoes the burden
of love and puts out, taking
the goddamn city in and under.

I’ve been thinking about the anatomy
of the egg, about the two interior membranes,
the yolk held in place by the chalazae, gases
moving through the semipermeable shell.
A curious phrase, the anatomy of the egg,
as if an egg were a body, which it is,
as if the egg could be broken then mended,
which, depending on your faith, broken yes,
but mended? Well. Best to start
again, with a new body, voided
from a warmer one, brooded and turned.
Better to begin as if some small-handed
animal hadn’t knocked you against a rock,
licked clean the rich yolk and left
the albumen to dry in the sun — as if a hinged
jaw hadn’t swallowed you whole.
What I wanted: a practice that reassured
that what was cracked could be mended
or, at least, suspended so that it could not spread.
But now I wonder: better to be the egg or scaled
mandible? The small hand or the flies, bottle black
and green, spilling their bile onto whatever’s left,
sweeping the interior, drinking it clean?
I think, something might have grown there, though
I know it was always meant to be eaten,
it was always meant to spoil.

This rosebush assiduously forks over
its works where most grandifloras falter,
thriving as far into the year as Capricorn.While named after a lover,
it decorates its own altarand wields an extraordinary thorn:
once I saw it catch a football
in those semiquaver quasi-teeth;
it is three-headed, like Cerberus,a hybrid drawing bloodlines from a root-ball

slightly disguised for the journey, no longer appalling.
— Rainer Maria Rilke, tr. by Stephen Mitchell



The fresco cracks cooperatively over time. Not to give a secret away
but gradually to break off keeping it. In the sky you make birds
like this, one wing longer than the other, an asymmetrical v
wedged against wind, one stroke longer than another,
never the bodies turned the same direction, each finding
its own angle, and one, in the distance,
a dot. These are the Deadly Birds of the Soul
Rilke was forced to call terrifying.
Migratory, weighing no more than a pencil.
Because every flying thing is passionate, and every flight
a posture torn from stone.
There was a time it was a theme
parents would pay an artist to realize — the face of a beloved son,
a Luca or Piero, painted onto the shoulders of Tobias,
painted into the company of Raphael. You tell yourselves
and your quiet house
no harm will come to the boy
as he goes out. A guardian, though, is not a guard. To keep safe
is subtly different from confining. Radiance can strategically
direct itself to seem like us, ready, as it were, to walk.
As a mirror goes through the appearance of requiring
subsistence, goes through the motions of a meal
whose food appears to be food.
Radiance, we know, is never quite as warm as light.
Who has not tasted the silver in sea mist?
Whosever they are, angels are the first to surface there.
You know a guardian by the silver of a river-crossing,
of a father’s filmy eyes, in gall, heart, fire,
and mostly smoke. In smoke and mostly mirror.
As, wedged between forward and backward being,
rehashing and planning ahead, presence will be specked again
with being erased, a reusable writing surface
calling down to the life without rest, the self-propelled
surveillances of sharks.

crowned to the chest, rabbit

laughing their way up the sky’s fever-continuing threshold of three

I, sobbing in the rolling mist,
Started for peopled days. In dreams
A faded, lonely promontory shed petals.
Belief exists. Cunning with its perfume
Working from youth, defiance. A phantom
Vanished. The swift surrenders, leap into
The old dead heart of lies.

Into foliage. Of what light unseen!
What, what, what, what, what, what
Will hold still without its end?

On occasion, when the mood takes him
as it so often does, he will put down
his papers, get up from his kindly old chair,
and leave for a while the sweeping beam
to sow its charitable seed — that seed which,
when falling on the ground
of a helmsman’s fertile consciousness,
ought germinate in it a cautious vigilance.
He descends then, the long corkscrew of
the stairs and opens at their base the metal door
so that he may take a closer look at what might
be beyond his tower’s environs. There he always
finds the churning world, she laps at him from
every side with no respite, and spatters him
with spray. Thanks to a certain modulation,
a tone which he adopted long ago
when he still wore shorts and buckled shoes,
there is no danger here from neither shark
nor crocodile, not in this sea stuffed as it is
like a dressing-up box with whimsy.
Indeed, were there such creatures hidden
neath the sliver-thin surface of the waves,
they’d have no teeth but only soft gray gums
and goofy grins, and they’d be giggling
knowingly at the whole thing. And so it is
that as he gazes out, he cannot help
but wonder what it is he might be warning of
with the light that turns atop his tower,
because that tower is itself in fact the only
hazard anywhere on which a ship might rip her
wooden skin and haemorrhage her lumpy

You recount the history of the French garden.
From above, I see tight rows of trees beside threadbare grass.
When the language teacher talks about le capitalisme:
the gesture of three fingers rubbing imaginary fabric.
I’m a tourist, vulnerable and stupid,
my legs showing, shoes practical, face red.
Together, we try to reconstruct an anecdote
whose contents have scattered. A motorcycle passes, a French police siren
you say sounds innocuous then we both laugh sourly.
I hadn’t seen a woman slap a child in some time.
A truck reversing, and the alarm that continues for hours one morning.
Porn on a handheld device, its tinny echo in a room
with bare floors and very little furniture.
Across the courtyard, this T-shirt on a hanger out the window
turns in the light breeze as if trying to look behind itself.
I’m consumed with not knowing where to buy paper, safety pins, stamps.
The window frames of that building are red, emerging from gray gables.
Enormous bumblebee at the threshold investigates the doorway, doesn’t enter.
The flies do; they’re promiscuous; they leave.
I don’t know the word for because.
So each act is disconnected from another.
I can almost imagine there are no consequences,
the days just pass, one sunny, one cloudy, someone unseen shouts, sirens
every few hours, clouds move in a solemn procession across
a wide sky staggered with chimneys,
people wait to cross the street, a large tree tosses its wig a little.
Other small trees in the courtyard flicker.
They are responsive.
The sun heats the pavement; le pavé répond.
You send me a short erotic video, you’re naked, propositioning me.
Do you act more like the coin or the water?
Across the narrow street this bird
sipping from roof puddles
seems more dove than pigeon.
Pacing, grandmotherly, she stops to look at me.
Do you just know how to love another person
like someone knew to paint those window frames red?
Most of the architecture looks floral, like a boring math problem.
The crosses that reach and reach.
Why does the scrape of the furniture when I rearrange it
sound like crass American English to me?
I slept late, now I’m watching the clouds, like clouds
in an eighteenth-century painting. Overly articulate.
Except these clouds are not trying to symbolize anything.
Where’s my dove.
I always want to go look at people.
A booth selling copies of copies of Louis Vuitton.
The small shadow the roof makes on another roof right next to it.
When my friend came to Paris she wanted to break everything.
Impeccable shoes on the impeccable feet.
Clothes so new they’re creamy, and to seem to never have to  compromise.
I feel tattered when I’m actually not.
I’m an American, I eat.
A huge decorative basket of citrus snugged beside me in the upscale bistro.
The woman from a building opposite comes down, indignant:
Who threw a pomelo into my window?
You read to me about the history of the barricade.
I picture the drab suburbs.
The shoulders and elbows of people in the museum evoke more reaction
in me than most of the paintings.
A young lithe person with live eyes tends bar, gender trouble tattooed up their arm.
I count twenty-nine sleeping bags lined up beneath the overhang
and each one inhabited.
I read to you about the history of enclosure.
Two people talking on a balcony, their black hair blowing.
One leaning over into the courtyard.
Behind the cathedral, vulgar black felt stapled in the raised flowerbeds
to mask their frames.
The river stinks, allures, as a specific person can.
A repository, a consequence, a long sentence, an ongoing story.
The generous current cut through by a party boat shouting

waving at whatever will wave back.

It was winter. The opposite of burning,
which is also burning.
My banner displayed clock parts,
a cup of wine, a worm eating its opposite head.
My motto was Try to Be Responsible,
but every new moon was a sacrificial moon.
Thirteen paving slabs were flipped into the river.
The extra light of spring threw our business
into relief. My banner displayed a sunburst,
a bloodied hand dropping a knife, and
in the other hand an avocado withholding
its stone. War would soon come but not
for us, and this became our motto, Not for Us.
Then a crime in our community led to anger.
Gossip gathered the truth into a ball;
paperwork was spoiled; a man was removed
from the yellow light of the barn.
We heard his sobs coming from the orchard,
and these were a source of comfort.
Summer roused lanterns of dust under doorways,
though a vinegar taste kept the air difficult.
Antifa angels bathed their eyes in milk,
as horses refused riders. The timid among us
signed petitions swearing that when the time came
we would know it by the rocks in our hands.
I made a banner for the protests to come
depicting the planting of milk teeth,
the burning of a noose, a stadium left empty.
Autumn was just my luck. I could not stomach
the broth I boiled, and slept badly.
Arguments I won in my head lost direction
when formed out loud. The riots continued
but quietly now, indoors.
It was a time for manifestos, though the wrongs
were too many for anything less than a lake.
Friends kept the counsel of friends.
In the yellow light of the barn we tried to write
sentences each other would like, or not desire
to alter. Together we designed a quilt depicting
the wolf taking scent, water moving quickly,
the sign of the errant cloud and alphabet,
a baby resisting sleep, a worm eating
its opposite head, only this time surrounded
by snow, which hasn’t stopped falling since
Thursday, the name we gave to our child.

When, sticky with pink barbe à papa,

Resembled the crazy-maze passage of our caroming bumper car,
We were met by a stream of sangliers — 
Wild boars — 
Dashing across the D9 near the Forêt de Cavillargues.
They pelted in a single ribbon, as I recall,
So how could we even tell what they were,
How distinguish that ruche of  shadow and wind

That trails behind village names all around here.

Given to Roman soldiers after service in North Africa

Cavillargues. The acres of Cavillus, perhaps.
The hairy pigs had emigrated, perhaps from the Caucasus,
And no doubt had settled the Val de Tave long before Cavillus
Arrived to begin gentrification.
He wandered from the marble steps of the Maison Carrée,
Perhaps having paid obeisance to Roman gods and governors,
Perhaps uncertain from an encounter with the local plonk,
And les sangliers came out to give him a thrill,

Choice by extinction sounded ominous
to Yanks like us — we all remembered the war.
But that was just Herr Schreiff’s personal English.
We were on the same side now, building the thing,
the thing,
the VTOL fighter.What’s today? There must be
some big dates coming up, historic dates.
He’d say, Cold hands frog heart, and it became a gag
among the engineers: Soft hands wombat heart,
Sweaty hands lawnmower heart.The docs in this place
want to put in a pacemaker; I said no,
I’m not in this for the long run.
On his birthday Schreiff brought in three bottles of schnapps
and we sat around half pickled trying to do the
do the
debug the navigation. What a fright?
Patty —     Debbie —    Susan called, wanted to know
could she bring me anything. I told her, My old brain.
I used to be smart, you know?I’m assuming someone
is in charge of the dates, the historic dates.
Schreiff had worked for Heinkel during the war,
on those last-ditch plywood jet fighters
that kept disintegrating in midair
and killing their precious test pilots.
Ah Christ, look at this mess! Where’s the thing,
the thing
to call the nurse? Someone needs to deal
with those important dates, it’s allsodisorganized.

                our hands churched into our laps. We are not allowed
to touch. The air between us thick as Perspex.

The origin of the word prison
is the Latin prehendere — to take.

and forgot to forgive. Something has to hold you: numbers, columns,
cards to swipe, books to shelve,

Not the sad boy who blamed you for all the ways he was broken.
Not the man’s name on the wing, but
why not the battered wing itself. Why not the woman thinking.
Why not the river below, its lips wet, footprints animal.

Over the years they hunted,
the wayward apprentice watchmakers,
the disappointing sons who transformed
their surnames, hunted over acres
of hinges, cogs, calluses, hidden whiskey,
mustaches a breath from feral,
poured an ocean of fortune
into fabrications of brass and iron,
spent entire seasons strumming
massive harps of wire into perfect
calibrations of invisibility,
prayed to the gods of adjustable mirrors,
cursed the gods of temperamental gaslights,
broke the legs of imitators and thieves,
chewed holes in each other’s pockets,
harnessed nightmares of giant silver hoops
making endless passes over the bodies
of the dead, hoisted high a cenotaph
for hundreds of sacrificed rabbits,
breathed miles of delicate thread
into the lost labyrinths of their lungs,
all to make a woman float
to make a woman float
and none of them ever thought
of simply asking her.

Six years ago, the big museum sold eight famous paintings

Gustave Caillebotte’s Man at His Bath.
Now it’s hip to have a print of it,
and whenever I see one hung for decoration,
I’m almost certain that this is what Caillebotte
had in mind when he broke out the oils
in 1884: some twenty-first-century bitch in Boston
catching a glimpse of a framed reproduction,
recollecting a study about how washing oneself may induce
a sense of culpability. What I remember
is he insisted I clean before leaving. That, and he was
trying to be dreamlike. He took my jaw in his hand
and said in the next life, we’ll really be together,
and the clamp in his voice made me almost
certain he knew something I did not. Now I eat right,
train hard, get my shots. This life — I’m angling

The comet contended that fire
is romantic and recommended we each behold it alone,

did not reply. Then we discovered the men

After Nadia Reid



This spirit she came upon me as I slept — in such a way
my life or yours could come to be so thoroughly owned — 
she was reckless — I knew she would make me run away
with her — I said spirit, slow down — but the spirit wanted
to ride — but I am so afraid, I said — I have all this tenderness
to impart — but the tenderness is not mine to give away — 
but all your tenderness is your own tenderness, said the spirit — 
it is not, I said — why then did you give it all away? — I did
not give it away — then it is yours to give away — the spirit
riddled like this — if in her arms I read a story — if out of her
arms I had the choice to write one but I chose not — chose not
because I did not know where I was going — because my path
broke down & I had this choice — stay or split — if I knew that
were I to split one part of me would become a ghost — if I did
not know yet which part — if the voice calling me out asked me
to describe the splitting & I did — if I said it was like smoke
spiraling outwards — it was like smoke lifting off me taking on
form & leaving me — if  it was like a delicate girl I never met
but dreamed of — if it was like the flags of my youth fluttering,
far out at sea — like breathing out a breath you will never take
back in — but you know you can never take any breath back in — 
if I saw her outside of myself & mourned her like I have mourned
no other loss — if I knew it was both a miracle & the most terrible
tragedy — to open up — release a flame — watch the flame go — 
have you seen it? A flame that can ride water — she was my
daughter & if I could I would send her to you, if I sent her to you
would you take her? Listen, I ran this out of me because I knew
it would burn me down — my trainers press the ground & lift up
again — I saw myself on my back in high grass in high summer
with everything coming to me — how this ghost left me & printed
a new person all over me — I could peel her off or live like this — 
I cried — one or both will destroy me! — the spirit called it fate but
I knew it was just drama — I will never know why a good person must die — 
fate does not exist I said, but every door I opened showed yesyes yes — I shut each one & locked it — checked the locks
three times — went back & checked them again — shook them to be
sure — drew hearts round the keyholes so the spirit would know
I loved her — it wasn’t — it was never — that I didn’t love her —

What can I tell you? It was a summer that seemed to be
making history — their personal history — almost before
it began, and they stood back slightly, still in it, but
observing it, saying “the summer this,” “the summer that,”
all the while it was going on. They became obsessed with
a fountain, for example, one they walked past each day,
how abundantly it would reach upwards and yet be pouring
back down itself the whole time — all winter this fountain
had been dry, not saying a word. What more can I tell you?
Oh, everything — like how they would walk home in
the evenings when the light was soft, anything bad sliding
off them, and they would feel owned, completely owned,
in a good way, by the air, which would touch them constantly,
sometimes urgently, sometimes lightly, just to let them know
it was there, and they would think maybe this is what being
alive is, when they saw how complicated a tree was and how
it wanted them looking at it and saying this, how the color
of a particular flower at this particular moment was redder
even than the life force, whatever that is, if you could open
it up and get right down inside it, if you could put your mouth
to it and become as red as that rose even, it was still redder
than that, and they wouldn’t know what to do with themselves
so they wouldn’t do anything except listen to the songs in their
heads which were sad ones like nearly all good songs and watch

How hard it is to sleep
in the middle of a life.
— Audre Lorde



We wake in the middle of a life,                    hungry.
We smear durian            along our mouths, sing soft
death a lullaby. Carcass breath, eros of  licked fingers
and the finest perfume. What is love if  not         rot?
We wear the fruit’s hull as a spiked crown, grinning
in green armor.   Death to the grub, fat in his milky
shuffle! Death to the lawlessness       of dirt! Death
to mud and its false chocolate!   To the bloated sun
we want to slice open and yolk                      all over
the village. We want a sun-drenched           slug feast,
an omelet loosening its folds like hot Jell-O. We want
the marbled fat of steak and all        its swirling pink
galaxies. We want the drool, the gnash, the pluck of
each corn kernel, raw and summer                   swell.
Tears welling up                     oil. Order up! Pickled
cucumbers piled like logs for a fire, like fat limbs we
pepper and succulent                in. Order up: shrimp
chips curling in a porcelain bowl like subway seats.
Grapes peeled from bitter bark — almost translucent,
like eyes we would rather see. Little girl, what do you
leave, leaven              in your sight? Death to the open
eyes of  the dying. Here,           there are so many open
eyes we can’t close each one.          No, we did not say
the steamed eye of a fish. No eyelids fluttering like
no butterfly wings. No purple yam lips. We said eyes.
Still and resolute as a heartbreaker.         Does this break
your heart?                                      Look, we don’t want
to be rude, but seconds, please. Want: globes of oranges
swallowed whole like a basketball or Mars or whatever
planet is the most delicious.                   Slather Saturn!
Ferment Mercury! Lap up its film of dust, yuk sung!
Seconds, thirds, fourths! Meat wool! A bouquet of
chicken feet! A garden of                   melons, monstrous
in their bulge!               Prune back nothing. We purr
in this garden. We comb through berries and come out
so blue. Little girl,                            lasso tofu, the rope
slicing its belly clean. Deep fry a cloud so it tastes like
bitter gourd or your father leaving — the exhaust of
his car, charred. Serenade a snake and slither its tongue
into yours and                           bite. Love! What is love
if  not knotted in garlic? Child, we move through graves
like eels, delicious         with our heads first, our mouths
agape. Our teeth:         little needles to stitch a factory of
everything made in China.      You ask: Are you hungry?
Hunger eats through the air like ozone. You ask: What
does it mean to be rootless? Roots are good to use as
toothpicks. You: How can you wake in the middle of
a life? We shut and open our eyes like the sun shining
on tossed pennies in a forgotten well. Bald copper,
blood. Yu choy bolts                  into roses down here.
While you were sleeping, we woke to the old leaves
of  your backyard shed and ate that and one of your
lost flip-flops too. In a future life, we saw rats overtake
a supermarket with so much milk, we turned opaque.
We wake to something boiling. We wake to wash dirt
from lettuce, to blossom into your face. Aphids along
the lashes. Little girl, don’t forget              to take care
of  the chickens, squawking in their mess and stench.
Did our mouths buckle                                at the sight
of  you devouring slice                after slice of  pizza and
the greasy box too? Does this frontier swoon for you?
It’s time to wake up. Wake the tapeworm who loves
his home. Wake the ants,                  let them do-si-do
a spoonful of  peanut butter. Tell us, little girl, are you
hungry, awake,                               astonished enough?

ran the whole gamut from oysters to soup to — well — 
boiled beef to strawberry-rhubarb pie
and a little whisky after, some of it spilled on the

there were four or five small cardboard “houses,”
both of us remembered,
the homeless had claimed to sleep in and provide
a safe place for their black plastic garbage bags,
the size of a room at the Sloane House on 34th Street
near the Pennsylvania Station where I put up
the price of a meal then for a clean pillowcase
with little or no stuffing and a cardboard
bed as stiff as metal and a cardboard
breakfast of cardboard bread and eggs and between us
we talked cardboard, shirts from the cleaners with sheets of
cardboard we drew on, cardboard soles in ruined shoes
we both wore when we were children, cardboard hats,
cardboard to lie on listening to outdoor concerts
and cardboard masks we made with scissors and crayon
for costume dances, balls is what we called them
as if we were art students in Paris about to
swim in the nearest fountain.Though what I want to
say is the bees were too busy to do us any
harm and it was packs of wild dogs, not swarms
of bees, that terrified me (Larry, too) except for one
occasion when I pushed the wrong end of an old
broom into a hive of yellow jackets on the underside
of a low-lying garage roof and an angry swarm chased
me through the yard and over a fence hating
any form of criminal intrusion, urban renewal, or
gentrification, I who couldn’t resist intrusions,
who never could, omnivorous as I was, living on
apples and bananas as well as baby lamb chops,
who ran like hell that day (Larry, too)
for we in our separate ways didn’t want to be
paralyzed then eaten by larvae, none of us dead ones did.

Your ridiculous behavior, you’ve been loved.

The city never changes, it’s never the same.
Sometimes the inhabitants restore a building, patch it up,
But in a generation they’re dissatisfied, they try again,
Expose the old parts so you see them
Plainly, ruined or not.
Who schooled you?
What made you scared of change?
Vividly you remember a child’s body; likewise you remember a man’s.
You woke up one morning,
There you were, a stinking adult.
What happened between? What will it be like,
You’ve seen the images, to watch your body spoiling
From the inside out, your lungs, your arms,
The muscles in your face — 
Look out the window,
Choose a single brick.
Once, a long time ago, the city was old.

Clouds desire the sky, the sky the sun. The wave
Desires the land on which it trembles,
Repeating the same question, day after day — Am I allowed to ask for what I want?
And every day the land responds,Of course you’re allowed.You’re allowed to be angry, to rail,
You’re allowed to curse the God who put you here.
I’ve buried many people, old people, young people.
I’ve buried children while their parents wept beside the grave.
But I’ve also seen miracles.
Remember when they told you
You might die? You didn’t, you’re alive.
And every month since then, each minute, every second is a miracle.
What happens next you cannot know.
Is it better or worse to live longer?

it started with the first time
i opened the closet in my new
bedroom. paper flecks bursting from
behind the door. they had been waiting
all millennia. you helped
me pick them from my hair but even
weeks later we’d still find pieces
in between teeth — under tongues — 
on shoulders & lodged beneath fingernails.
you were always so gentle as you’d release
them out the window — same as you’d do
for a spider. when finished with
a rainbow it is the task of the youngest
angel to put it through the paper shredder.
he crouches in the cloud mist — taking
handfuls of the body’s remnants.
he learns not to weep after years of practice.
the first rainbow he shredded was that one
that we tried to follow in your car — 
driving around wet fallen trees — mist
rising from the asphalt. we never did get there
but we did stop for ice cream. you bit
the bottom off the cone. the sound
of the rainbow’s destruction was only a dull
static noise to us down here. i noticed
it but didn’t want to tell you. the next
time i was tearing open what looked like
a credit card offer in the mail & out
came the confetti. we had just stopped finding
it on everything — gushing like an artery
i covered my face until it was through.
mounds upon mounds of color. stole the rake
from my aunt’s shed we had used to rake leaves
in early october before the weather gave
herself over to frost. i resisted the impulse
to make the confetti into piles to leap into.
you were coming over & i wanted to be
clean. the next time we slept together
i transported myself somewhere else as you kissed me.
sat on the collarbone of the rainbow as
it was shred along with my hair. me, with the
thousand-piece body. me, getting blown
away by the first breeze. me, inhaling
the tears of the kneeling angel. i came
back to the room when you knelt,
spitting paper out of your mouth. confetti began to
pour out from behind my lips, miraculously dry.
each time i tried to apologize more came out;
you, naked on the bedroom floor trying to dispose
of the colors as they came. flow mountain spring.
flow slit neck of a pig. flash flood &
flow melted ice cream down to our elbows.
by the time it stopped your fear turned to anger.
slammed the door as you left & there i
was with all this color. i put some in my mouth
but it was too bitter too swallow.
if i don’t kiss anyone this won’t happen again — 
i can keep it a beautiful secret. routine:
each morning removing the piles of cut paper.
when you come over i sometimes find them on your
skin. you don’t notice so i kiss them off
your neck. i’m trying i’m trying.
i peel the rainbows free & roll them up like
yoga mats in the closet. the shredding has
gotten so loud — i ask you if you hear
it & you shake your head, unknowingly.
i can’t stand it — i can’t stand it.
caress this color out of me.

                ","
all the rain came down at once like a dropped bag
of aquarium pebbles. too much for the street to swallow:
all gravel & grit. i feel the saltwater rushing
in my mouth as i hit the shore — sand becoming rice.
the pot on the stove — put on the lid. we read the
back of the bag — bring the water to a boil — it
protests in the clouds. rainwater peeling open
car windows to fill the floor — make mobile your
lakes & the herons will come — don’t feed the birds rice.
my favorite summer storms are the ones
that come too fast. they remind me so much of myself:
gathering their gray hair in a bouquet to beat
against the highway. i think of the times the thunder
would toss geodes at the street until they cracked open,
about dad telling my brother & i to go upstairs
& shut the windows before the storm snuck inside.
the car prayed until it drove on water — ocean barreling
toward us like a great big whale: blueness open & mouth full
of salt. you ask if we should stir the rice & the water
hisses & spits. we often forget about the ghosts
who kneel in pots of water. there’s always a wooden spoon. i keep
mine in the glove box. taking it out, i park the car with
the four-ways on. other monsters slosh past.
we get out on the side of the road. kneeling i plunge
the spoon into the bank: chicken broth & rice.
rain warming our bodies until there’s no
mistaking us from the stove. i burn my feet getting
back into the car. our flesh turns chicken-white & tender.
somewhere in all of this i managed
to drive across the whole unknown ocean — the one
without a name that shows up only when it downpours.
makes tides that eat radar & sailors.
picks rice grains from her teeth.
the other side is not land, but soft rice steaming
& ready. our legs sink in. take a spoonful of me
before i drive home a second time. the sun emerging like
a quartered bell pepper. i’m thinking of
lying in a rain puddle with you & falling apart
into a palm full of cooked rice.

the unified field 
It wasn’t that there was anything to say
that would stop him from feeling this way — the X
of himself splayed out in space
where gravity was weakest. He and his father
and talkative mother
suffering tiny strokes that took away
this syllable from this word, that syllable
from that, all this lay
in one pan of the balance scale
while in the other there was nothing but dark matter

a toast to pavlov’s dogs 
Oh Leash held by a hand I can’t see, here
in the laboratory where nothing can change
and where yips and bites are fine-tuned to the pack’s mentality,
am I one of his dogs, the three-legged one that knows nothing
of my lack except for how I bark, growl,
and whine to be let in? Am I the salivating triangle
guided only by my nose that keeps me
on the move in my limping trot away from you, Leash, yanking
me back from all the filth I want to shove my nose in?
Why won’t you let me go free? The sad gestures
of our growing intimacy is a reflex we
can’t escape or express: sometimes, emotion is just mange.
So Leash, here’s a toast to my lab pals: August, Fast One,
Pretty Little Lady, Joy, Beauty, MiLord, Clown.
 
the judgment after the last 
What would we like to see happen?
Would we like to drive nails into our hands?
Would the shame engulfing us like flame
on a computer screen make us understand
that throwing a match into the Grand Canyon
while snapping a selfie, and never once thinking
how far that match falls, is the original sin
that a donkey’s ears twitching
as we ride it to the bottom reveal as the truth
about our consciences? How many nails
will we need? Go to the movies, do research,
be the Regulator forced to kill kill kill
and that’s when we’ll find out just who we are
or if there’s anything like “who” anymore.
 
mission 
It’s not simply that the palm trees are on fire
but that they waver up more fire than fire,
brighter and harsher and more intoxicating
than the flames spreading ever thought of being — 
the thick black smoke turning noon to midnight
rears up in a wall that nobody can see
over or around or through even as this nobody
comes crashing through the screen
right into my living room: poor nobody! In this loneliest of times,
he tells me how much he loves me, how his lack
and mine feel somehow the same and that the flames
crawling over him have become his mission:
burning, he erects a burning house of smoke
we can neither live in or abandon.
 
sunday is never the last day of the week 
Using zip ties and Velcro to strap on a homemade bomb,
who is to blame, who should have told us
that on the far side of the screen in this Sunday calm
our generation has had its time? In that corner
where we slept together so many nights, yes, in that corner where
the bed of the dead lovers has been put out with all the other
Monday morning trash, there are always two doors
opening and closing as one of us goes out and the other comes in.
Why couldn’t we show our love for one another
the way the void dissolves into the zero? Why did the animal
grafted to the human find such satisfaction in explosions? Darkness
to darkness, ashes to ashes, the animal to the human,
why shouldn’t we take pleasure where and when we can — 
provided this is pleasure, provided that the body isn’t null.
 
last rites 
Even if the suit they dress me in for my funeral
is dry-cleaned at Perfection Laundry, then washed
and washed in the blood of the lamb, the knees
will still be muddy from kneeling down, the sleeves,
mismatched, will tell their own threadbare tale
about the breath of life breathed into tabletop dust.
What would the naked man and woman and talking snake say
about the god who no longer remembers if they’re forgiven
or not? Listening as a kid to the old stories,
there were never enough beanstalks and giants
and Jacks. Now, the pallbearers pick up my coffin,
they carry me out to the ruined cathedral where the saints’
wooden faces, frozen in their homely expressions of grace,
are shadowed by flocks of  blackbirds whirling past.
 
coda: the hunger artist as a senior citizen 
Nowadays, in my cage
in old straw, where
my brother keeper
forgets to come feed me anymore,
at last I’m fasting for its own sake,
not to break records I’ve broken
a thousand times before.
Besides, nothing could be easier
than to starve forever
if the food they keep on
giving you makes you sick.
This hunger is a moment’s
vision that will persist
in a pillar of radiant house dust.

                ","



For  Jack Agüeros (1934–2014)



I was eight when the blackout struck and the lights died all across the city
like a massacre of fireflies. In the projects of Brooklyn, I steered myself
to 14F, fingers spread against the cool tiles of the hallway, past the concrete
and chicken-wire terrace where I once burnt ants with a magnifying glass.
Many years later, at the Chinese restaurant uptown, Jack said: They got any flan here? He was my first poet. I had seen the fireflies in his sonnets
blink and float away: Fulano the philosopher in the unemployment line;
Blanco the painter, painting in the madhouse; Monterosa the dealer killed
by shotgun in a bar on Avenue A; his mother the seamstress and the quick
needle of her sewing machine; Jack the moving man, his hands sliced raw.
He stacked his apartment with dictionaries in three languages. I knew
the raconteur’s grin with every tale: Raúl Juliá is a friend of mine:a Puerto Rican playing Macbeth. He took 14 curtain calls on opening night.
Maybe he would tell me now that flan was not Puerto Rican, or Mexican,
or Spanish, but Chinese, invented by a trembling cook to satisfy the palate
of an emperor in the Ming Dynasty. No flan, Jack, I said. This is a Chinese restaurant. Two minutes later, he said: They got any flan? I showed him
the dog-eared and fingerprinted menu. No flan, I said. When the waiter
unfurled his pad, Jack said to him: You got flan? He sang this song for an hour.
The egg roll was not flan. The fried rice was not flan. The fortune cookie
was not flan. Can we get some flan? he said. Goddammit, Jack, I said.
The poets crowded into the bar, striding to the mic. Jack stood with poem
in hand, read the title, tilted his head and said it again, studied the page
as if the words shriveled up like ants burnt under a magnifying glass,
then sat down. I witnessed the massacre of fireflies. A few of us clapped,
not knowing what to do with our hands, staring at the sonneteer who lost
all his quatrains and couplets in the denim jacket he left on the subway,
the words of Fulano still waiting on the unemployment line: The faster you spin, the stiller you look. / There’s something to learn in that, but what?
After the diagnosis, I handed Jack a book of poems. He dangled the book
upside down like a stiff mouse by the tail, something we would sniff  behind
the refrigerator. I wanted sonnets. Jack kept singing the chorus of a song:Get me to the church. Get me to the church. Get me to the church on time. 
At the end, I leaned over Jack’s bed to read his own poem in his ear, but some
words come home after the blackout, fingers crawling on the wall. I know
what I should have said at the Chinese restaurant: Jack, let’s get some flan.
We should have braved the subway at rush hour, straphangers rocking
all the way to 14th Street and 8th Avenue, to La Taza de Oro, gone now
like Jack, for rice and beans, squid in its own ink, café con leche y flan,
Jack: a spoonful of flan for you after all the years of sonnets and bread
for me, the steam rising when your hands cracked the crust at the table.

Poverty is black ice.
— Naomi Ayala



You leave me sleeping in the dark. You kiss me and I stir,
fingers in your hair, eyes open, unseeing. You leave me asleep
every morning, commuting to the school in the city at sunrise.
The landlord’s driveway, a muddy creek, ices over hard after
the freezing rain clatters all night. Your feet fly up, your head
slamming the ground, an eclipse of the sun flooding your eyes.
You sleep under the car. No one knows how long you sleep.
You awake with a hundred ice picks stabbing your eardrums.
You awake, coat and hair soaked, and somehow drive to school.
You remember to turn left at the Smith & Wesson factory.
The other teachers lead you by the elbow to Mercy Hospital,
where you pause when the nurse asks your name, where you claim
your pain level is a four, and they slide you into the white coffin
of an MRI machine. You hold your breath. They film your brain.Concussion: the word we use for the boxer plunging face-first
to the canvas after the uppercut blindsided him, not the teacher
commuting to school at sunrise in a Subaru Crosstrek. Yet, you would
drive, ears hammering as they hammer in the purgatory of the MRI.
A week before, Isabela came to you in the classroom and said:Miss, I cannot sleep. Three days, I cannot sleep. Her boyfriend called
at 2 am, and she did not pick up. At 3 am, a single shot to the head
put him to sleep, and he will sleep forever, his body hidden beneath
a car in a parking lot on Maple Street, the cops, the television cameras,
the neighbors all gathering at the yellow-tape carnival of his corpse.
You said to Isabela: Take this journal. Write it down. You don’t haveto show me. You don’t have to show anyone. On the cover of the journal
you bought at the drugstore was the word: Dream. Isabela sat there
in your classroom, at your desk, pencil waving in furious circles.
By lunchtime, as her friends slapped each other, Isabela slept,
head on the desk, face pressed against the pages of the journal.
This is why I watch you sleep at 3 am, when the sleeping pills fail
to quell the strike meeting in my brain. This is why I say to you,
when you kiss me in my sleep: Don’t go. Don’t go. You have to go.

                ","
The landlord says we have to go. On the night the thermostat read seventeen
below zero, and there was no heat on the first floor, the Massachusetts State
Sanitary Code appeared in the landlord’s in-box like a spirit tapping bony
knuckles on his window, and a letter appeared in the landlord’s in-box
like a spirit scratching the words no rent in the frost on his window,
and the landlord’s mouth foamed as if he’d swallowed detergent,
and the foam froze on his beard, and the landlord’s plumber laid
twenty-four feet of baseboard on the first floor, and now we have to go.
The landlord keeps his purple vintage 1976 Monte Carlo parked at the edge
of the driveway, purple inside and out, paint job and upholstery purple,
the color of emperors. The mad emperor Caligula assassinated his cousin,
jealous of his purple cloak, and the mad emperor’s mouth foamed
as if he’d swallowed detergent, and the foam froze on his beard.
The neighbors report a moose sighting today. The moose charges from the woods,
mad as an emperor jealous of a purple cloak, sees the purple vintage
1976 Monte Carlo as another moose, and rams Caligula’s chariot with
his bristling antlers, kicking the car the way a teenager high on detergent
T-boned my leased Toyota Corolla two weeks ago, and so the moose claims
his territory, this land without a gas station or a movie theater or a pizza joint
or a doctor’s office, and gallops back into the woods, snorting foam.
Now come the hunters tracking the moose, crossbows bristling since crossbow
season is upon us, their vision blurred by a night of Red Bull and detergent,
and see the purple vintage 1976 Monte Carlo as a moose, firing volley
after volley of arrows into the windshield, and the talisman of the air freshener
hanging from the rearview mirror does not keep the glass from exploding,
and the jumper cables coiled in the back seat do not rise magically like electric
eels, and the hunters explode in a cry of huzzah, waving their crossbows
as if their arrows thumped the hump of Richard the hunchback king.
The purple vintage 1976 Monte Carlo is a dead moose, tow truck dragging
away the carcass to a round of applause in my brain. The landlord will snort
and foam, demanding to know why there is nothing left but his mutilated
vanity plate stamped with the year 1976, and I will speak to him in Brooklynese,
palms turned upward in the universal gesture of the uncooperative witness.
He will keep my security deposit, his territory without a gas station
or a movie theater or a pizza joint or a doctor’s office. I say huzzah.

I close my eyes and see him windmilling his arms as he plummets from
the Mystic Tobin Bridge, to prove me wrong, to show me he was good,
to atone for sins like seeds in the lopsided apple of his heart, but mostly

I hated the 111 bus, sweltering in my suit and tie with the crowd in the aisle,
waiting to hit a bump on the Mystic Tobin Bridge so my head would finally
burst through the ceiling like a giraffe on a circus train. I hated the 111 bus
after eviction day in Chelsea District Court, translating the landlords and judges
into Spanish so the tenants knew they had to stuff their clothing into garbage
bags and steal away again, away from the 40-watt squint that followed them
everywhere, that followed me because I stood beside them in court. I would
daydream in the humidity of the bus, a basketball hero, flipping the balled-up
pages of the law into the wastebasket at the office as the legal aid lawyers
chanted my name. I hated the 111 bus. I had to take a taxicab that day.What the hell you doing here? said the driver of the cab to me in my suit
and tie. You gotta be careful in this neighborhood. There’s a lotta Josésaround here. The driver’s great-grandfather staggered off a boat so his
great-grandson could one day drive me across the Mystic Tobin Bridge,
but there was no room in the taxi for chalk and a blackboard. He could
hear the sawing of my breath as I leaned into his ear, past the bulletproof
barricade somehow missing, and said: I’m a José. I could see the 40-watt
squint in his rearview mirror. I’m Puerto Rican, I said. It was exactly
5 pm, and we were stuck in traffic in a taxi on the Mystic Tobin Bridge.

To be honest, I had my first surgery when they pulled me deadfirst headfirst from between my mother’s thighs.

My first ten years were mostly marked by my relentless pursuit to not look pregnant when I went out in public. One of my goals each day was to not have someone ask me in public — hopeful look in their gesturing gaze, so excited by the prospect of a coming Christmas
miracle,
“Are you    ...?”
and to have to shatter their hopes of Dream Baby, and simultaneously begin the Emotional Labor of soothing their embarrassment after hearing, “No.” Because a woman with a swollen or distended abdomen can only mean one thing. And that thing is always joyous and awaited with excited anticipation. A woman with a distended abdomen couldn’t possibly be dealing on the daily with something gone terribly awry. Couldn’t possibly be engaged in an ongoing war for her body, a custody battle for her own self. A woman’s swollen belly is everybody’s Good News, everybody’s Business.
So that’s how I spent five years in my thirties: running around evading expectations my deceptive uterus induced in family, friends, and rank fucking strangers.

This used to be my house I said
But those are not your people
So that can’t be your house

I had some people maybe a few
Even though those are not your people
Even though they don’t look like you
I had to live somewhere I said
This is the house where I lived
But where are your people he said
My people live in a different house
They don’t care to know about me
If you’re the devil
Why are you asking me questions

                    The Parable of Perfect Silence
                ","
Today I woke and believed in nothing.
A grief at once intimate and unfelt,
like the death of a good friend’s dog.
Tired of the mind reaching back in the past for rescue
I praise the day.
I don’t mean merely some mythical, isolate instant
like the mindless mindfulness specialist
who at the terminal cancer convention
(not that it was called that)
exhorted the new year’s crop of slaughters
(ditto)
to “taste” the day, this one unreplicable instant of being alive.
(The chicken glistened.)
Nor do I mean a day devoid of past and future
as craved that great craze of minds and times Fernando Pessoa,
who wanted not “the present” but reality itself,
things in their thingness rather than the time that measures them.
Time is in the table at which I sit and in the words I type.
In the red-checked shirt my father’s mother used to wear
when she was gardening and which I kept
because it held her smell (though it does no longer)
there is still plenty of time.
Two murderers keep their minds alive
while they wait to die.
They talk through slots in their doors
of whatever mercy or misery
the magazine has ordained for the day — 
the resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan, say,
ten signs that a relationship is on the rocks.
When their communion flags, as communions will,
they rekindle it with personal revelations, philosophical digressions,
humor. This is a true story,
one of them says sometimes by way of preface,
as if that gave the moment more gravity,
asked of the listener a different attention,
at once resisted and reinforced an order
wherein every hour has its sound, every day its grace,
and every death is by design.
“Love is possible for anyone,” I hear the TV talk-show host say,
which is true in the way most things in this life are true,
which is to say, false,
unless and until the nullifying, catalyzing death is felt.
Love is possible for anyone
because it is equally impossible for everyone.
To be is to be confronted with a void,
a blankness, a blackness that both appeals and appalls.
Once known — known by the void, I mean — one has three choices.
Walk away, and unlearn the instinct of awe.
Walk along, and learn to believe that awe asks nothing of you.
Are you with me, love?
(For love read faith.)
Naked once and after a rat, my father cried, “Die, vermin, die!”
banging the broomstick over and over on the floor
so incorrigibly dirty it might as well have been the earth itself.
This is my mother’s story, though I was there, I’m told,
and no small part of the pandemonium.
We were five souls crammed into one life,
and so incorrigibly poor — or was that fear? — we all slept in one room
and shared one great big chester drawers, as we called it,
and not with irony but in earnest ignorance,
just as like meant lack, as in
“How much do you like bein’ done with your chemo?”
and just as I and every other child I knew,
before we tucked into our lemon meringue pie,
solemnly wiped the calf slobbers off.
Ah, local color, peasant levity, the language fuming and steaming
rich as the mist of rot that rises off the compost heap
(“kitchen midden,” you might hear an old Scot still say).
When do we first know? That there’s a world
to which we’ve been, not oblivious, exactly,
but so inside we couldn’t see it, who now see nothing else?
Heaven is over. Or hell.
Did you forget the rat?
It thumps and thrashes like a poltergeist inside
the chest of drawers but somehow, though my father is fast,
and though his rage is becoming real, every drawer he opens
is empty. What happens when we die,
every child of every father eventually asks.
What happens when we don’t
is the better question.
To kill a wasp on water is the peak of speed.
My brother who is other has a mind of lead.
I with my stinging griefs watch from away.
How can it be there are no adults left?
What matters here is timing, not time.
His hand is high and white above the blue.
A wasp is also atom and urge, hover and touch.
Even wings are not a clean distinction.
Down comes the slap like a rifle shot.
What vengeance can there be on blank necessity?
My brother who is other has a way.
His hand is high and white. And then it’s not.
Once when my father’s mother’s health was failing
and she found it more and more difficult to tend
to the tiny family plot at Champion, Texas,
which is less town than time at this point,
a blink of old buildings and older longings the rare driver
flashes past, I took it upon myself to salt the graves
as I must have read somewhere would work for unwanted growths.
As indeed it did.
In the months after, every Sunday when we spoke,
she thanked me for the blankness, the blackness,
(my words, of course)
this new ease I had allowed her mind.
Until one day leaning over with flowers the leached earth
opened and my eighty-year-old grandmother
tumbled right down among the bones
of the woman from whom she’d first emerged.
To see that image you have to be that sky.
It has to happen in you, that crushing calling viewless blue
that is so deeply in you that it is not you.
“O, Law’, honey, I like to died.”
You don’t climb out of poverty so much as carry it with you.
Some shell themselves with wealth.
Some get and spend, get and spend, skimming existence like a Jesus lizard.
But for those whose souls have known true want
— whose souls perhaps are true want — 
money remains, in some sense, permanently inert,
like an erotic thought that flashes through a eunuch’s brain.
In 1980 my father bought his first airplane,
a scream-proof four-seater we crammed five inside,
which he considerately slammed into a sorghum field alone.
Unkillable, he killed the next ten years with work and wives,
then bought another, and brought it down in the solitary fire
that was his aspect and atmosphere. Homes, schemes,
thirty years of savings plowed into a sign company (!)
that did not, it turned out, exist.
A hole is hard to carry.
People ask if I believe in God and the verb is tedious to me.
Not wrong, not offensive, not intrusive, not embarrassing.
Tedious.
Today I saw a hawk land on Elizabeth’s chimney.
It sat with its bone frown and banker’s breast
above the proud houses of Hamden.
Are you with me? Then see,
too, a lump of animate ash rising from the flue
(or so it seems) to be a pigeon
fluttering dumbly down
next to that implacable raptor,
suddening a world of strange relations
wherein there is no need for fear, or far,
or meat.
There was a man made of airplane parts,
one of which was always missing.
He wandered the hospital grounds in search of a rudder,
an aileron, or some other fragment
that would let him fly from this place
where he was not meant to be.
There was a woman who emitted invective
ceaselessly, dispassionately, an obscenity machine.
One timid gentleman saved Saran wrap for five full years
and every night wrought an ever-more-solid ball
with which, it turned out, he planned to bash the skull
of the first soul he saw the dawn God blessed his weapon.
(A success story, alas.)
Another man with anvil hands sat six months of nights in faith
that there would come occasion of darkness, unguardedness, and vision
sufficient to rip from its socket one of my father’s bright blue eyes.
(Ditto.)
My father moved among them like a father.
He attended and pacified, he instructed and consoled.
Late to the trade, he worked too much,
and trusted his heart, no doubt, more than he should,
but was, by all accounts, at this one thing, and despite the end, good.
For love read faith
into these lines that so obviously lack it.
For love let words turn to life
in the way life turns to world
under the observer’s eye, the swirl
of particles with their waves and entanglements,
their chance and havoc, resolving
into some one thing:
a raptor on a rooftop, say.
No power on earth can make it stay.
But is it lost or released into formlessness
when we look away?
To be is to believe
that the man or woman
who inscribed with an idiosyncratic but demanding calligraphyFuck da money — Trust no one
on the rough blanket of the residential motel
where my father spent the last two years of his rough residential life
intended the note of defiant, self-conscious (da!) humor
that left my father, whom I had not seen in years,
and I, whom years had seen grow sere, far even from myself,
erupting in laughter until we cried.
Before my good friend’s good dog died
ten times a day she pressed her forehead to his
“to confirm the world and her place in it.”
Now she won’t even say his name.
Strange how the things that burn worst in one heart
one must keep silent to keep.
Ten to one you thought of men.
The murderers, I mean.
But no. This is a true story.
There is another cell, you see,
in which a woman I have known since childhood,
and since childhood have known to be
suspended on a wire of time but nimble-witted nonetheless,
lies on the cold stone floor.
She is even more naked than they have made her.
She has killed no one not even herself.
Punishment, perhaps, or some contagion of fate, finds her here,
her hair shorn, both wrists wrapped, her eyes open,
pondering the parable of perfect silence.Remember, he said, memory is a poor man’s prison.

                ","

Her story is a part of something larger, it is a part
of history. No, her story is an illumination
of history, the matchstick lit in the black seam of time.
Or, no, her story is separate
from the whole, as distinct as each person is distinct
from the stream of people that led
to the one and leads past the one. Or, her story
is surrounded by history, the ambient spaciousness
of which she is the momentary foreground.
Maybe history is a net through which
just about everything passes, and the pieces of her
story are particles caught in the interstices.
Or, her story is a contradiction, something ordinary
that has no part in history at all, if history is
about what is included, what is made important.
History is the galleon in the middle
of the Pacific Ocean, in the middle of the sixteenth
century, swaying like a drunk who will take
six months to finally reach his house.
She is on another ship, centuries later, on a journey
eastward that will take weeks across the same ocean.
The war is over, though her husband
is still in his officer’s uniform, small but confident
among the tall white officers. Her hair
is marcelled like a movie star’s waves,
though she has been too sick with the water’s motion
to know that anyone sees her. Her daughter is two,
the blur of need at the center of each day’s
incessant rocking. Here is a ship, an ocean.
Here is a figure, her story a few words in the blue void.

Research is mourning, my friend says. Which means what,
exactly, for the things listed in the archives
as filling the galleons when they left Cebu and Manila — 
ivory objects, jade objects, copper objects,
brass objects, lacquer objects, mother-of-pearl inlaid furniture,
pearls, rubies, sapphires, bolts of cotton cloth,
silks and gauzes, crepes and velvets, taffetas
and damasks and brocades, stockings, cloaks, robes,
kimonos, bed coverings, tapestries, linens, church
vestments, rugs, blue-and-white porcelain that numbered 1,500
in one ship, wax, tallow candles, cordage,
sailcloth, musk, borax, camphor, cigars, varieties of tea,
cinnamon that was dried and powdered, 40,000 pounds of it
listed in one ship’s manifest, cloves, pepper,
nutmeg, tamarind, ginger, martaban jars from Burma,
dragon jars from China, Vietnamese jars,
Siamese jars, Spanish jars, 800 jars found with the wreck
of one salvaged ship, jars that would have
contained tar for caulking, oil, wine, bizcocho bread,
salted meats, dried fruits, lard, bacon, beans, chickpeas, lentils,
flour, garlic, cheese, honey, rice, salt,
sugar, food for months, not enough food, not enough water,
chickens, cows, pigs, up to one thousand souls
depending on whether the ship had a tonnage of 300 or 500
or 1,000 or 2,000, ships that in the 250 years
of the trade route wrecked somewhere along the way
more often than they arrived in Acapulco, sailors,
mercenaries, officers, noblemen and their entourages, priests
and missionaries, slaves that were called indios
or chinos, nails, tools, iron cask hoops, fireworks, opals — elegy?

                    Yael
                ","
Yael picks at their cuticles. When they speak to themself, they speak out loud. They speak to themself this morning. I think, they say, that I am coming down with wisteria. Their nail beds a bit purplish.
There’s a Caesar cipher decoder ring in their shredded wheat and, unsure of what to decode first, Yael hides it under their pillow. Yael says, Today I’ll be lonely. They need the practice.
Yael never drinks their cereal milk, pours it back into the jug. But they are thirsty. Outside of their tent, the lawn is still entirely a lawn — the neighbors kept to themselves last night, trampled none of the daffodils. A good omen. Today Yael can leave their tent without fear. Of what? The omen has no answer, it presents only the bright of things.
Yael shoves three empty bottles into their bag and heads toward the river.
 

•


The pigs are having a swim and pay Yael no mind as they submerge each bottle. Yael imagines the bubbles that shimmy out are the  bottle’s breath, that they have the power to take breath from anyone.
The hair on their arms turns golden. Then the water. Then the pigs flee. Yael looks down as Sun approaches. They were already kneeling.  Their shins disrupting the path of an ant colony’s leaf-carrying  ceremony. The ants do not bite Yael — Sun is watching, and the ants like being alive, love to feel the weight of a veiny leaf, love even more the sound their mandibles make piercing through that leaf.
Sun kicks a flowering fennel as He walks toward Yael, but forgets to change the wind’s direction. The seeds blow into Yael’s hair and up their nose. Though Yael did not see Him do it, Sun gives himself away by whining, It’s not my fault.
 

•


Sun’s whine reminds Yael of their husband, Heber. Heber whines like that when Yael wants to leave his tent. When Yael doesn’t invite him into their tent. When Yael doesn’t want to watch a movie that Heber has seen a dozen times.
It’s exhausting to be shown things, to try to enjoy a movie while also giving a convincing performance of that enjoyment. Heber ruins these screenings — he weeps before the scenes that call for weeping. He mouths each pivotal line.
So far, Yael has spent their life absorbing men’s favorites. On the rare occasion that Heber does ask to watch their favorite movie, Yael can’t remember having one. This makes Yael feel a creaking, hollow-boned kind of gloom.
This gloom opens the flaps in their brain that make them want to lie in bed all day.
Yael does not know the sound of their loudest yell. All their noises  have been practiced. Maybe this is why Sun’s whine makes their cheeks flush. The sound is a selfish one. Why should it go unpunished?
 

•


Sometimes, when they think of Heber away at war, Yael grows giddy,  presses their smile hard into their pillow until the whirling joy  subsides. But what is the mainspring of that giddiness? They try to dissect the thought:

          Heber = Giddy
                    Or
                              Heber away = Giddy
                                        Or
                                                  Heber away at war = Giddy
 
•


If Yael were to look up from the dirt, they’d see the kestrels circling above, their left talons leashed to Sun’s wrist by neon green fishing line. Taut line. No give.
Yael won’t look up.
Sun exhales and lets loose His belly. It peeks out from under His shirt. You can keep thinking of me as Sun. He’s relieved Yael is alone. I’ve been looking for a new name. His old name felt stale. Dead by comparison. Sun is perfect.I have a very important job for you, Yael, descendant of — He’d left His notes at home — Yael. Enlist in my war against the wicked and blessed shall you be above all people in the tent.
Sun doesn’t mention that Yael isn’t His first, or even His second, choice.

pretending to be a man, pretending to be a Jew

the rest of us float and bobble like space trash

One of those idle hours I did not want
To participate in “group,” when it seemed
Impossible I’d know a word to haunt
Again, or make me laugh, or spur that dream
To roam myself the ranges of the tongue;
When on that ward I thought not one aspect
Of anything, no matter how strong, strange,
Or keen, could sharpen the “blunted affect”
Even electric shock had no effect on    ...
During one such despondent interval
I read these lines from his New Directions
New collected poems, and the verbal
Sequence somehow composed the correct code
To unlock feeling: corridor, right hand,

After  Jean-Michel Basquiat



Crows
               and more crows.
One crow
               with a rat
                              hanging
               from its beak,
sloppy
               and beautiful.
Another crow
               with its wings
                              plucked
               empty.
I wanted
               so much of today
                              to be peaceful
               but the empty crow
untethers
               something in me: a feral
                              yearning for love
               or a love that is so full
of  power,
               of  tenderness,
                              the words
               fall to their knees
begging for mercy
               like tulips
                              in wind.
I don’t wear the crown
               for the times power
                              has tainted
               my body,
but I can tell the difference
               between giving up
                              and giving in.
If  you can’t, ask the crow
               that watches me
                              through the window,
               laughing as I drink
my third bottle of wine.
Ask the sound
               the tree makes
                              when the crow has grown
               disgusted
with my whining.
After years of repression,
               I can come clean.
                              I was a boy
               with a hole
other boys
               stuffed themselves into.
I have wanted
               nothing to do with blackness
                              or laughter
               or my life.
But about love,
               who owns the right,
                              really? Who owns
               the crow
who loves fresh meat
               or the crow who loves
                              the vibration
               of its own throat?
Everything around me
               is black for its own good,
                              I suppose.
               The widow,
the picture of the boy
               crying on the wall,
                              the mirror
               with its taunting,
the crows
               that belong
                              to their scripture.
Can you imagine
               being so tied to blackness
                              that even your wings
               cannot help you escape?
About my life,
               every needle,
                              a small prayer.
               Every pill, a funeral
hymn.
I wanted the end
               several times
                              but thought,
               Who owns this body, really?
God?
               Dirt?
                              The silly insects
               that will feast
on my decay?
Is it the boy
               who entered first
                              or the boy
               who wanted everything
to last?

In the old place, there was no place
that did not see me.
Wherever I went mothers whispered
about me like a Greek chorus:I heard that boy    ...    I heard that.
I was just a boy. But it was
true, what they said, that I liked
other boys, that I had stolen Sarah’s,
though he was four years older
and they were very much in love.
I made him break up with her
in a Chili’s parking lot
while I waited inside. I was
fourteen. How embarrassing
to have been fourteen, to have eaten
at that Chili’s, often. That summer
I had no taste for anything
but him. Faintly of chlorine.
When he left for college
I had no one. Sarah’s friends
stared me down at school.
I found it was better,
if I could not be no one,
to be someone. Small, but
particular. Specified, which was
an apprenticeship for special.
Cold, another word for cool.

baby, meaning untidy, confusing, monumental,
great in size, and also, of or serving
as a monument, which leads me to reconsider

                                                   Danger, can you feel

For Hasna Henna and the Rohingya



Lice? My aunt once drew a comb through my hair steady;
she wouldn’t let what feeds on blood eat my inner tree.
Where now is the word for such intimacy? I know it still,
but all I see are jungles burnt of our rarest trees.
My point is: it takes a while to say, “I am a fire hazard,” or,
“a household of rare birds” is another way to say tree.
I wrote one draft of this poem, then she died. Will I
forget her name, Hasna Henna? Let’s smell a tree;
night-blooming jasmine, o-so-heavenly! A sapling
succeeds by flourishing from a tree’s seed.
How else to perfume these needs we breathe? A sapling
of course = a small and soft tree (i.e. baby tree).
I grieve the rice she fed me off a palm leaf.
Only now can I fully marvel: how finely formed is a tree!
Someone I loved said to stop with the oceans in my poems — 
well, oceans + oceans + oceans! We drown so many trees.
(Night blooming tree = baby tree = once and future tree.)
Lately, all I think about are trees.
Read this again to replace tree with refugee.
Tarfia = joy in the margins + one who lies to protect trees.

I.M. Ché Frye



i 
Kubla Ché, dreaming of ancient
Egypt, ate his hyacinths and was
marvelous. Wherever you are is
what I’m meant to say. Before you
beauty come, Dis crouching among
the black basalt, kneading master’s
soured linen, watching (bewatched)
the great beaten gold litter borne by,
deltoids sun-dewed stone, temples
bronze & strong &     in train     in
       thrall perpetual — 
                                I am of a mind,
daddy. Like, inside the blind-white
cloth-of-gold, the scented, sweating
box she sat in (think box, lock box) — 
Phoenician forest, seeder of  known
world’s every known green: malachite,
sea-green jasper, chrysocolla, olivine — 
& outside, too, other-handed, other-
landed, in rainless, treeless Thebes, my
dark knees tendered by two lands, rubbed
bare by work & love — 
       Move the tombs to the cliffs of
Beni Hasan. Send salt from the four
lakes. She is Nefertiti, she shares
the crown, she brings the single sun.
You do not watch the sun. But in
the Deeds of  Suppiluliuma she
says she is fearful     but there is no
fear past true heresy, her beauty is
clear of the next line & the next and
that kind of  beauty is     if not
redemption the possibility of a
separate resurrection.
      (Am I not beautiful too?)
      The miners are instructed: Find a
vein, gouge it to the very end.
 
ii 
Princeling Ché, wolfling Ché, fish-
eyed prodigy, anabole, brother
mine, all-beautiful boy, who’ll turn
your pages now? The lines unfurled
before you in your sleep, who sets
them to song? I cannot. (All men
have crowns and every crown can be
broken.)
       Were your senses mixed (blood
shaking your heart — orange, with
violet veins) or did hearing alone
stay and go last, were your nostrils,
at last, unblocked, your ears, at last,
symmetrized, did you unravel
first silence    did you dream?
       Maimonides says of Abraham
it is not God he disobeys but
Elohim; that in the bureaucracy
of divine instruction the envoy
fore the eyes supersedes the voice
in the ear     did they close your
eyes, daddy?     they must have
closed your eyes (enucleate the
globe, ligate the four recti, fix in
formalin) for under the sole edict
of sound
                     the son is killed.
 
iii 
Of  your father we dare & do
not speak.
 
iv 
Wherever you are, you are not
your death. You are not your cold
body, your subclavian blood, your
spine upon the body block that
proffers up your organs, your
humors pooled with gravity — you
are abed in natron, my friend, you are
forty days not in a metal slot but
roused into the mirror world, the
eastern fields of light, the father
sun rayed gentle on the rushes &
not the prosector but the jackal
keeps your stomach & the falcon
your intestines and your heart
remains your heart is yours for you
there are no more tests of   heart.
 
v 
My friend, magnificent, across your
empty desk they go on trading base
metals & precious gems. They found
flint in feldspar caves, below the first
cataract, where single stones, actioned
by wind, can mother a dune. They trade
tin south to children of  the stars, mix
alum with deep-red alizarin to
dye, to delight them who are yet to
learn the violence of  such charm
       heart hanging in its bloodslick
chamber     heart gleaming in its
rubied darkness
                   My husband, my god,
my gold-mad son
                                               lorn
issue, dim & darling eyes flooding
with natal sand, every night flooding
my free past. What’s a queen know
of this     my babies in their sunless
cease     what’s a queen’s knees know
but milk & crystalled honey     her
throat but subtle Mareotic wine     sun
smelted to gold, disced & sledding
behind her
       the whole world’s whole life
given her to give — 
 
vi 
Look, the dreamer comes!
                     Was this what you sleep-
conceived, this equal dialogue     this
black silt talk rife in death & germ
all-mixing, estuarizing, high-banked
along the flood’s go-down? (it
lowers down its voices, the flood     it
helps me to think, blessed ram, of
death as flood     for in it all
things high & low, fair & dun, flax
& inlaid faience, free & liened &
husbanded are leveled, meet, and
proven in the engorged     the
enchafèd delta.)
       I see it now. (The trick of death
is that it keeps returning.) Lady of
all women, they call me, they are
all my children now. (Labors of
my dim life.) I will prepare each
part for them. (From the front, no
back     from behind, no face     am
I purged at last of the various
envies?)
       I will build a city for you.
      (I will build a city for you.)
 
vii 
Twenty years ago we were nineteen
and already elegiac, we were
future tensed & annealed, we were
quenched in the dark peace of
violent histories — Karnak, Babylon,
Persepolis, Byzantium — the names
alone     (quarry our bones, convey
us to Karnak)     our names we
preserved, bent to stave & strophe,
accomplishing our envy, gathering
our violence, we were altogether
desire, (only ever) all we would
be     full of  imminence     (light
first, sun later)     stayed, asituate,
unforgiving.
 
viii 
Now you are time’s but I say to you,
Ché, in full mouth: We will be perfect.
There will be a recognition. The skill
has left your fingers, the dream your
brainpan but time, too, is prospected by
work     (the lumen of the vein)     (the
schist afire through the rock) and humans,
too, may burn like candles, their spines
wicks, their feverdreams the sputting
flames — 
       Work in the shadows. We will work
in the shadows, the rest being the
madness. Naughty naughty boy. Ward
residuum. Hold to murmur, hold
to method. You see? Time breaks along
its faults, lays bare its jeweled fragments
for those who love and work. It gives
it all for free. It asks only reversion
at the end. (And like, that end whereof
we could not think     thereof  (no
questions asked) you spake & said, My
father     and you answered, Here am I,
my son)     O tell me — go, you go
first (you went first) — what reason
makes this right, what insupposable
value, what excuse but ultimacy which
all know to be the breath of evil?
       I will build a city for you.
 
ix 
About beauty they really got it, those
masters: great wonders call for great
suffering. The father straps down
his son, carves along the throat’s chalked
crease (signaling purpose), the slavers
slough off infants into sand holes
(streamlining, focusing the workforce),
the queen conceives eternal city, she
deracinates a people to upraise it
with their bowed backs, mortar it with
their warm, oxygenated blood     sunk
generations & contingency &
opportunity cost     gambling our
own lives’ great gamble: that wrong,
actioned by time, can be made
soluble in art.
                                            So,
Volchénochëk, you may be absolved — 
I tried & trying.
 
x 
Listen, I want to say something to you.
You arrived just in time. You told me
they’re not better than us, you honored
our sin, repaired my will, you were
havoc in the trees, the dense infolding
fire & its fuel at once (white fusion,
wild usufruct)     always your mind
was the Emergency, always severaled,
chording the upper & lower, equal
& bonded in appetency, bonded
always to mine.
       This is a moment of children.
Who cares who sees? (Who sees?) We
scoff at faultless entropy, we strip the
pith from the inner stalk, we count to
three. Talk me into it, daddy (the
first rolls were blank)     oxidize
this carbon black significance — heart
of water — this red hematite & blue
frit, these yellow ochres that every
child knows enflesh the unreal
sun — 
 
xi 
Put it another way: the ink gleams
for three more words before it (and
meaning) sets. In those three beats I
must be thousand-faced, entelechied,
liable, I must be totally told on — 
       in the middle of my life
a myth, a tidal mouth, I am planted
in bitter celery, in the phytolithic
matrix     all-possible clay     I sense
your slow impulsion all around me.
       Heart’s lake, calendula on my
fingers, laughter in the morning-
golded reeds (shaking the papyrus),
the scale in the wind that shakes
the reeds, deus absconditus, the only
gossip of the living, I miss you
so much.
 
xii 
Either we are eternal, with neither
end nor beginning, or we are
sprung from a single thing and
proliferative — in either case death
is not death (though time cannot but
give form to suffering). Believe
(if you must) as I must:
       In all things moment.
       In each thing everything.

She steps into La Roue de la Fortune movie theater

and so swiftly the waters roll

in the labyrinthine pitch to preserve
order, the expulsion from Eden, the dark
soda up her clear plastic straw, reels
of rodents, popcorn, teenage workers,
acne, blood and circulation turn to ice
inside this mechanized paradise,
where reality meets the sound of gardens
growing past their makers’ dreams,
growing strange and outrageous.
She stops to check her phone
and the phone lights up, Putin, Botox,Trump, the garden grows outward, up,
to each side, the ghosts are simply
plants who forgot to stop growing;
they groan, shriek, quake, giggle, gurgle,
stare, and point fingers at the living.I’m glad I’m in love, she thinks.

                ","
There was this bear cam
on the Internet. It was pointed at a place
called Katmai National Park, Alaska. A few years ago
my friend sent me a link to it.
I would watch it sometimes
but I never saw any bears.
Maybe it was bad luck
because my friend said she saw bears.
All I ever saw was the enormous river rushing
and the tall pines in the background doing nothing.
I mean, that was OK, of course.
I loved the sound of the river
and wind in trees and the sheer thrill
that such a sublime nothingness
could be witnessed like this.
But I wanted to see a bear.
It seemed even more thrilling to be typing
in a cubicle and suddenly out of nowhere
there’s a bear on your screen
that maybe 50 other people in the world catch
a glimpse of. Maybe they are on a break from Facebook
or filling out a spreadsheet and BOOM, a bear.
So I thought while I was writing this
that I would just check the bear cam online
and sure enough a fat bear is in the middle of the river
eating a salmon right there in the Katmai National Park.
I get up from my desk and tell my colleagues
“You guys, come here!” and my colleagues
come in my office but by the time they run in
the bear crosses the river, or pixelated
screen or whatever, salmon in his jaws
and the only thing there is the river
and trees and they say,
“Sandra, this is boring,” and walk
back to their own offices.

I was probably worst at selling weed — 
robbed weekly, used too much
of my own product, cut each bag
with a dash of oregano — 
but then I have to consider that summer
Matty asked me to help him boost cars,
his dad called me a liability — 
too paranoid to be lookout,
too shaky to use the slim jim,
didn’t even know how to drive stick — 
oh yeah, & let’s not forget
that time Mo almost lost an arm
after I convinced him to pay me
twenty bucks to stitch his wound
with fishing line instead of going
to the hospital, or that time
I convinced Aliyah to let me
tattoo a cross on her ankle
with a safety pin & a ballpoint — 
& then there’s that time I swiped
a Stentor from Carl Magee’s locker
& tried to set myself straight
by becoming a violinist,
but of course, the noise complaints,
the neighbors banging the portraits
off the walls, the boys talking shit,
calling me prodigy, fancy chink — 
& I wonder if they’re still having
a good laugh, like when they found out
I wanted to be a poet & so they glued
roses & violets to the hood of my Kia,
& so maybe I wanted, for the first time,
to prove them wrong, prove
I didn’t belong there,
& so maybe I made new friends — 
friends who wrote poems,
who sat around talking about poems,
who went to school to study poems
and lived in off-campus apartments
where I crashed on nights
I got too fucked up on white boy drugs
to drive back to the Eastside,
where, even without me, the rosin glow
of junkers trace the block, where Mandy,
three years sober, tucks the kids
into bed, where Lee,
first in his class, spray-paints
the fleet of stolen bikes gold,
where Andrew stands in the kitchen
reading the Bible in the dim light
from the microwave, where Nikki,
years later, coming home
after a double at Champps, calls
to wish me a happy birthday,
& I am, of course, too busy
to answer — somewhere in a different time
zone, at a swanky party celebrating a man
I do not know, who just won an award
for a book I have not read
& the woman who smells of citrus,
who’s been raving to me all night
about how much she admires my work,
excuses herself to use the bathroom,
leaving, in the seat beside me, her open purse.

Anything can be a bird if you’re not careful.
I should say something nice about the weather.
I should be in awe of the living, but the world dulls
when I step into it. The squirrels scatter, the branches
lift. Sure, I’ve hurt the ones I’ve loved
by not paying attention. Not alone — never alone
is a lesson I need to understand. It was you who said that.
It’s you still. You who says, Look! You who points
to the sky. You who tilts my chin toward the heron,
who cups the minnow in your hands,
who spots the deer miles ahead, who dulls
the world with your absence. You who says, Look!
& when I look, you are gone, replaced
by the whitetail’s hind legs, fading into the bush.

It was a vertical time. It was the expression, a spirit giving way onto an electric barren. We
circled and were encircled and had no cause. It was a time of the self come on in a field of
apparatuses. It was vignetted by sleep, and the sleep was in its center breached. Cold moving
through the smell of gas. The big-leafed enclosure. It was a time that clattered at the horizons,
whose recounting was already foreclosed, as in a numeral smudged in powder, as in a thin water
making of the atmosphere a disc. It was a time of guzzling. A time amid what has been kept, a
time of calendered trust, repeated appeal, erasures of flight. We begin with a weedy stem drawn
against the winter sky. Dear hierophant, our decision initialed. The muffled sound of the closet

a pricking sensation
and numbness in one limb?
Can you hold this tongue?
Tell me, what is the function

You are the most yourself

One can be quick and too quick.
I have a stomach too.
It gets hungry.
If I be of necessity
opportunity,
if there be the slightest chance of success,
why have a mind, if?
Does that scream in the night across the alley
beg an answer? Are we crowning

An elephant is larger and stronger than a horse;
but it is not preferred as a beast of burden.
Strength is a wee umbrella

You turn toward a jade

stop at a light in its gut.

It crawls warm and dull to the west edge,

warming wide glass.

sharp legs brushing wild onion.

push the gray gate open,
allow the worn loop of my bag

This is to say we continued. As though continuing changed us.
As though continuing brought happiness as we had known.
 
On a dry field without cover, his skin blistered raw in the sun.
Not one among us came, as though he had no relations.
 
What did we say to our brother? How could we leave him alone
while soldiers guarded his corpse as though precious to them?
 
One of the women, in darkness, crept to the field where he died,
prayed for him, covered him up. Dust over what was not dust.
 
We would have ventured out with her if we had loved ourselves less.
We had to think of our children, and he was not coming back.
 
How could we live with the silence, live with our grief and our shame?
Death did not heal what he suffered. He was making demands.
 
We did not want him to be there, asking the question he asked us,
changing the sound of his name. He had embarrassed us.
 
This is the memory we carried, avoiding the thought that he remained
face down among the charred grasses, holding the earth with his hands.

     A local official came to our office to ask our help with a city event. He had a splendid idea, he said. To kick off the event and show everyone in town that our tribe was still around, we should go up to the bluff overlooking the city and make a big smoke signal. Then they would know we were here.
     Who ever heard of smoke signals in the forests? I imagined us upon the bluff, lighting one of those firestarter bricks. We haven’t made fire since the Boy Scouts took over. And how would the citizens know it was us? They’d probably call the fire department.

When I learned I might have cancer,
I bought fifteen white lilies. Easter was gone:
the trumpets were wilted, plants crooked with roots
bound in pots. I dug them into the garden,
knowing they would not bloom for another year.
All summer, the stalks stood like ramshackle posts
while I waited for results. By autumn, the stalks
had flopped down. More biopsies, laser incisions,
the cancer in my tongue a sprawling mass. Outside,
the earth remained bare, rhizomes shrunken
below the frost line. Spring shoots appeared
in bright green skins, and lilies bloomed
in July, their waxed trumpets pure white,
dusting gold pollen to the ground.
                                                                     This year,
tripled in number, they are popping up again. I wait,
a ceremony, for the lilies to open, for the serpentine length
of the garden to bloom in the shape of my tongue’s scar,
a white path with one end leading into brilliant air,
the other down the throat’s canyon, black
and unforgiving. I try to imagine
what could grow in such darkness. I am waiting
for the lilies to open.

Now begins the festival and rivalry of late fall,
the weird debauch and daring debacle
of frat-boy parties as students parade foggy streets in mock
processions, bearing on shoulders scrawny effigies of dead,
defeated Indians cut from trees, where,
in the twilight, they had earlier been hung.
 
""Just dummies,"" laughs our dad, ""Red Indians hung
or burned—it's only in jest."" Every fall
brings the Big Game against Stanford, where
young scholars let off steam before the debacle
they may face of failed exams. ""You're dead
wrong,"" he says to Mom. ""They don't mock
 
real, live Indians."" Around UC campus, mock
lynchings go on. Beneath porches we see hung
the scarecrow Natives with fake long braids, dead
from the merrymaking. On Bancroft Way, one has fallen
indecorously to a lawn, a symbol of the debacle
that happened three generations ago in California's hills, where
 
Native peoples were strung up. (A way of having fun? Where
did they go, those Indian ghosts?) ""Their kids perform mock
war dances, whooping, re-enacting scenes of a debacle
white folks let loose,"" chides Mom. ""Meanwhile we hang
portraits of presidents on school walls and never let fall
the old red, white, and blue. My dear brother is dead
 
because he fought in a White man's war. How many dead
Indians do they need to feel okay? This whole thing wears
on my soul."" In the dark car we go silent, and the fall
night gets chillier. In yards, blazing bonfires mock
the stars that glow palely somewhere above. A thin moon hangs
over the tule fogs. I've never heard the word ""debacle”
 
before and wonder what it means. ""What's a debacle,
Mom? "" I ask. ""Oh, honey, it's a terrible and deadly
collapse. Complete ruin."" I've noticed how the hung
Indians have their heads slumped forward. They wear
old clothes, headbands with feathers, face paint, moc-
casins instead of boots. Little do we know, this fall,
 
living Indians at Feather Falls
leave tobacco to mark that, indeed,
we're still here, lungs full of indigenous air.

We could hear her
knocking down strands of cobweb
from ceilings—sticky filaments,
sacs of eggs—as we woke most mornings
to a worm of discontent.
It lodged beneath the heart,
rubbed our frayed nerves,
gnawed at the gut, spleen,
ovaries. Filth
 
was Mom's first enemy, so each day
began with ritual cleaning: the stab
and sweep of the broom down the dark hall,
over the stained and scratched oak floors.
 
For weeks, she held her dust mop
one-handed, and with the other
cupped a hernia, while she swore
at us kids in that hard voice—a litany of our sins
and failures: sloth,
stupidity, secrecy.
 
We watched her
smash the spiders that ran, herky-jerky,
along the baseboards, while we ran, too.
 
Glaring at each other,
we gathered up the scattered
laundry, our father’s shoes,
his newspapers and tools, our books,
drawings, music, sweatshirts,
and jackets, whatever
we’d left lying around.
 
We were guilty, but good
at evasion. We cultivated
shrewish or obsessive behaviors of our own: my tough
older sister sneered and stalked out of the house
to meet her boyfriend;
my sweet younger sister
trembled and cried, comforted
by one of our many dogs.
I slammed doors, pounded them
with my fists, screamed, “Shut up,
shut up, shut up!” She couldn’t
 
leave us alone. She loved us
too much.
 
Though we were quick, she was
quicker. Her words stung.
 
We must have deserved it.

Desert heat, high clouds, and sky
the color of lapis. On this journey,
anything seems possible,
so we stop by an ancient cottonwood
to kiss. The beauty trembles,
doesn't say a word, just watches
me, so open. Small birds fly by, flock
in the shady tree above us. What
settles in her heart? What congeals?
Hope? Despair? Far off, the river churns
in its sandy banks, swallows veer, turn
in fiery air. Will these kisses seal
her to me? I her lover, she my wife?
Is all of this a dream, my whole life?
 
2
She is just this side of wonderful,
and suddenly the glamorous world
fills itself with shining and we laugh
at highway monuments that explain
how hard the trek had been for Franciscans
in the Indian wilderness, poor fellows—
conversion is the devil's own
work! Then the stones of her dream
turn up under her feet, the back
of a huge land turtle. I know
we must be circling Paradise
because the ants enter the fleshy petals
of the roadside flowers with evident
joy and purpose (oh, my dark, pretty one).
 
3
Music, my adored. When is there never
music? My accordion puffs up
with drinkable melodies. I spill
her tunes into your listening ear,
one after the other: the squeeze-box
enters the dance of the plaintive gypsy
with its hard rhythms, lilts the back-
breaking labor song the worker croons
to earth, warbles romantic notes of
dissolving borders. You melt
like a woman beneath her lover's touch.
Music is happy and pitiless when
it sets fire to combustible souls. Even
the raspy bandoneon's voice is lyric.
 
4
Sacred. Sacred. Sacred. Sacred. (Speak
in a whisper.) We slip into this
space half cognizant. The land is very
large indeed: bones of the earth
worn down, though she is a living thing.
See how she exposes her grace? Antelopes
graze on the far plain—their high,
white tails—the red soil throbs
its slow heartbeat, and the blue sky
clears so smartly, perfectly, like
radiance. Are the ancestors near?
What can we know? We decide
to wander around this prairie, mistaken
for Utes, buy commodities in little towns.
 
5
Late afternoon we head west along the willow-banked
Malheur after the long curve of the Snake River plain.
(Above the falls where the Shoshone went to pray
we soaked our feet in cold water, and I observed
the arch of her brown foot.) Rabbitbrush and sage
along the highway, juniper on far hills and bluffs.
Sundown, and dusk falls over the wide basin of land.
In Burns we eat eggs in a cafe, take a room
in the Motel 6. In the dark, I can see
her black hair, black against the pillows. Its clean
scent makes me think of corn. At dawn, I hold her
and there are kisses. Then more kisses. Then more.
The day is cold; a north wind blew last night. But
the land is open. Rain falls in showers of light.
 
6
Her hand on my thigh, my shoulder,
in my hair. She leans over to kiss my cheek.
We look at each other, smile. For miles
we travel this way, nearly silent, point
with eyes or chins at the circling hawk, the king-
fisher on the snag above the swollen
creek. One night I weep in her arms
as she cries, ""Oh, oh, oh!"" because I have touched
her scars lightly: throat, belly, breasts.
In that communion of lovers, thick sobs
break from me as I think of my love
back home, all that I have done
and cannot say. This is the first time
I have left her so completely, so alone.

Ours was a play-filled childhood; irrigation ditches ran deep
during the summers. We played in the water and dirt, then inscribed
ABCs and numbers onto the smooth ground. Our cat Polly died
of rabies; then all the pets had to be shot, some in the rib cage
as they thrashed in panic. There was a pink bruise
on my forehead from pressing against the wall. We couldn't figure
 
out how such a thing could happen. The dogs were steadfast figures
around the farm. They chased strange cars and sometimes invoked deep
panic among visitors and passersby. They had cuts and bruises
from scuffles with roaming packs. No tags were inscribed
with their random Navajo names. Snazzy was skinny; his rib cage
obvious through thin fur. He looked as if he might die
 
from hunger, but he ate like nobody's business. Who knew he would die
of rabies with the rest? The main thing was to figure
out how they contracted it, my parents said. We cried until our rib cages
ached; our eyes stayed swollen. This first loss was too deep
to even talk about. Decades later, I can finally describe
how that summer led us into a grief that felt like a bruise
 
that would last forever. But our neighbor suffered worse bruises:
their huge dog, named Dog, was the first to die
and was the cause of all this. Their home and fields are inscribed
in our memories as ""the rabies place."" Over time, they must have figured
it was too much to live down. Childhood losses run deep,
even though we are grandparents now. The memory is an invisible cage
 
of anguished sobs, gunshots, yelping howls, canine rib cages
exploding. Sometimes we reminisce and notice that the bruises
of grief have turned pale like smoothed-over scars. That initial deep
hurt was the start, we found, of how love could die
right before us, even as we watched: stunned figures
pleading for mercy, urgent prayers saying, ""Let God's scribe
 
mark this down. We've paid our dues. Our hearts are inscribed
with loss after loss."" For some reason, after everything, our rib cages
held up and continued to cradle tender hearts. They must have figured
that all the prayers and careful teachings would prevent bruises
that would weaken us. Our love for those homely animals was deep
 
and would figure in the knowledge that such bruises
aren't endless, and that our rib cages are not mere bones. One can die
from grief, so now we can describe loss and love as the Holy Twins.

For the graduates of the University of Arizona.



This morning we gather in gratitude for all aspects of sacredness:
the air, the warmth of fire, bodies of water, plants, the land,
and all animals and humankind.
We gather to honor our students who have achieved the extraordinary
accomplishment of earning doctoral or master's degrees.
We gather to honor their parents, grandparents, children,
family members, and friends who have traveled with them
on their path to success. They have traveled far distances to be here
this morning: we honor their devotion.
 
May we remember that holiness exists in the ordinary elements of our lives.
 
We are grateful for a homeland that has always thrived
on a glorious array of people and their diverse cultures, histories,
and beliefs. We acknowledge the generosity of the Tohono O'odham
in granting this land on which we learn, teach, celebrate
accomplishments, and sometimes mourn losses.
 
May we always cherish our ancestors as we prepare for the days ahead.
May we remember that we exist because of their prayers and their faith.
 
We are blessed with distinct and melodious tongues.
Our languages are treasures of stories, songs, ceremonies, and memories.
May each of us remember to share our stories with one another,
because it is only through stories that we live full lives.
 
May the words we speak go forth as bright beads
of comfort, joy, humor, and inspiration.
We have faith that the graduates will inspire others
to explore and follow their interests.
 
Today we reflect a rainbow of creation:
Some of us came from the east, where bright crystals of creativity reside.
They are the white streaks of early morning light when all is born again.
We understand that, in Tucson, the Rincon Mountains are our inspiration
for beginning each day. The Rincons are everlasting and always present.
 
Those who came from the south embody the strength of the blue
mountains that encircle us. The Santa Ritas instill in us
the vigorous spirit of youthful learning.
 
Others came from the west; they are imbued with the quiet, yellow glow of dusk.
They help us achieve our goals. Here in the middle of the valley, the ts'aa',
the basket of life, the Tucson Mountains teach us to value our families.
 
The ones from the north bring the deep, restorative powers of night's darkness;
their presence renews us. The Santa Catalina Mountains teach us that,
though the past may be fraught with sorrow, it was strengthened
by the prayers of our forebearers.
We witnessed the recent fires the mountains suffered,
and in their recovery we see ourselves on our own journeys.
We understand that we are surrounded by mountains, dziił,
and thus that we are made of strength, dziił, nihí níhídziił.
We are strong ourselves. We are surrounded by mountains
that help us negotiate our daily lives.
 
May we always recognize the multitude of gifts that surround us.
May our homes, schools, and communities be filled with the wisdom
and optimism that reflect a generous spirit.
 
We are grateful for all blessings, seen and unseen.
 
May we fulfill the lives envisioned for us at our birth. May we realize
that our actions affect all people and the earth. May we live in the way
of beauty and help others in need. May we always remember that
we were created as people who believe in one another. We are grateful,
Holy Ones, for the graduates, as they will strengthen our future.
 
All is beautiful again.

For Marilynn



 Nihideezhí, it was a moist June afternoon when we buried you.
The Oak Springs Valley was dense with sage, cedar, and chamisa;
and gray, green, and brown shrubs cradled the small cemetery.
The sky was huge overhead.
Your son said later, ""Did you see the sky? It was purple.
I knew it would rain,"" he said.
 
The dark Carrizo Mountains were so clear.
 
There were so many people, Sister.
Many of your friends whom we didn't know,
and your former schoolmates whom we remembered as children,
and Sister, we met many relatives for the first time.
 
We cried, not wanting to leave you in that serene place.
We hesitated, though our father, his parents, and their parents
are buried there. Our older sisters thought ahead to bring flowers for them.
They huddled quietly over their graves a few feet away.
 
Shideezhí, remember how red the sand is?
The men—your sons, our nephews, grandsons, and various in-laws—
took turns filling your grave. Their necks and arms were streaked
with dusty sweat. They kept their heads down;
their faces were damp and eyes, swollen.
 
We had to get it all out; we cried
and held each other. My granddaughters hovered near me
as if I might faint or fall unexpectedly.
 
Did you see, Sister, the way the grandchildren fed and served everyone?
They guided the grandparents and the elderly to their chairs.
Once seated, they served plates filled with mutton ribs,
potato salad, corn, thick slabs of oven bread, crispy fry bread,
and Jell-O salad. They placed the salt and pepper—that enduring couple—
before us and implored us to eat. The two delights we relished were good—
hot, strong coffee and cold, crisp diet pop.
 
We ate for you; we consumed your meal, Shideezhí.
We ate to honor the times you cooked for us—
those tasty dishes, scrumptious pastries combined with laughter,
silly childhood memories, and always teasing jokes.
Sister, I didn't know how we would make it;
it is still too much to think of you not being here.

Shadows lengthened while we sat stuck in traffic just beyond San Rafael. Headlights had begun to flare in the cool dusk. The hum of the car's engine lulled me, and I put my forehead against the glass, looking out over a darkening landscape. We were headed to the Bishop's Ranch, a weekend retreat for Episcopal Young Churchmen in hilly country that would someday produce superlative wines with garnet hues that stain the inside of a glass. I was queasy from the lurching of the car, the stops and starts, the smell of exhaust. Though trembling with cold, I was too shy to ask the lady, the mother of one of the other girls, to turn on the heater. I imagined pale pink blossoms on the Japanese plum, apple trees laden with white flowers, and north of Sebastapol the vibrant yellow of daffodils on slender, pleated stems. That night I slept in a single bunk made up with thin sheets and blankets.
 
A warm sun the next day restored me, but in the evening, seated by the fire that crackled in the fireplace of the big lodge, I felt flushed. Our recently ordained curate (we were not to know he was gay till some years later) had asked me to bring my guitar, and now he wanted me to sing about the girl who decides to sleep next to her mother her whole life long instead of falling for an unfaithful suitor. I sang; we all sang together. Young Father W. had a wonderful tenor voice. His smile reassured me, but now I was tired and, earlier than the others, I decided to return to the dorm.
 
In that clear March night, the sky gleamed like black ink and stars blazed, bright and alive. Walking downhill, guitar in hand, I suddenly stumbled with dizziness, and the slope swam before me. “Hold on, hold on,” I told myself as I nearly fell onto the dew-slick lawn. For a moment I could sense myself floating away from my body. Back in the dorm, I crawled into bed and lay shuddering with cold, bones aching. The room seemed to spin. I wanted to be home, but the thought of facing my mother filled me with terrible dismay. I knew the blue failure notice mailed by the school would have arrived.
 
Sure enough, it lay open on the dining table when I got home the following afternoon. A Sunday fog, hardly a mist, had blown in from the bay and was gathering in the eucalyptus across the ravine. The house was steamy. A basket of clean laundry occupied a chair atop a stack of San Francisco Chronicles. Mom sat at the table sewing, but I knew she was scowling. I thought it wise to look industrious, so I began to fold towels and pillowcases. “What I want to know,” began my mother, “is whether you have any ambition? Obviously, you will never get to college. What do you expect to do with your life?” She paused, and I shrugged. “Go ahead and shrug. Do you think your girlfriend is going to take care of you? That won’t last long. And why is it you only fall in love with girls? Well, I suppose you want to be a boy.” What an unutterable failure I am. I retreated, burned by her ferocious, upright anger. “Oh, yes, I’m sure you’re sick! But you will go to school tomorrow!”
 
That night, wracked again with cold, unable to stop my trembling, I sought my parents’ bed, stood moaning till Mom woke and let me under the covers, where she tried to warm me with her body. Weeks later we learned that one of my classmates, a robust girl who shot baskets as well as any boy, had succumbed to the illness and died. That night, my mother placed her hand on my forehead–her smooth palm, her touch, gentle–and said to my barely awake dad, “Our daughter has a raging fever.” Like a miracle, I was still her child. Comforted, I slept.

but for a road to be built,
 
brick by brick, word by word,
 
weariness replaced with joy,
but what is joy without the years
 
and the way they open constantly,
two or three hearts pumping a volume of blood
 
meant for just one?
 
                                   Our disbelief in the ordinary
emerges from the way we color routine:
 
leaves pile up depending on the wind,
but why pause to notice?
 
Eventually the seasons embrace
what our words will not, the illuminated day
 
just one of a thousand others,
and the names we give back to the world
 
mean ultimately little against the way
 
the sun pleads sense
from the smallest cradle of dew.

All at once that stubborn dog of a heart
stopped barking at Lady Poetry, jumped
over the wall where the sacred crows of
Kashmir dwelt and said: I've come into
this world to stay. It can't be, protested
the daffy nurses of Pickapoon Hospital.
It can't be, the guardians of the public
order responded in chorus. All at once
that heart stopped leaping, not in his
beloved Buenos Aires where he'd mis-
placed his violin for good or in Ukraine
where José sawed timber and memorized
train schedules. That stubborn dog of a
heart kept singing in the face of turbulence,
never knowing whether the Lady would
arrive. He put bars on his verses because
of issues with his lungs and thanked the
little birds that ate from his hand. He fed
the crows as well—""breadcrumbing,"" he'd
call it—ringing a bell while quoting
mystics in their native tongues. This is
why I've come, he'd say, but all at once
that stubborn dog of a heart stopped
speaking and drew a giant moustache
high up in the spheres. You can see it
if you dare listen to their music.

There's no cause for vanity and none for
pride: it's just a matter of assembling
words in lines, then dividing them up (or
letting them divide themselves), hoping
they sound good or bad. (What's important
is that they sound like something.) It's all
a question of staying alert so that red doesn't
bleed into orange or orange into yellow or
yellow into silence. There's no cause for
rejecting silence and none for accepting it,
either. We should speak when there's noth-
ing to say and be quiet when others talk.
That's the poet's business, so get used to it.
There's nothing glorious about it. The future
doesn't count for anything and the past just
laughs at us. There's no cause for writing
this poem and none for deleting it, either.

I had the most beautiful pale pink rose.
Its healthy stem was clenched between my teeth. And.
Its thorns bit sharply into my tender wet flesh. So.
 
I couldn't answer you. Still.
My lips moved at you silently.
They offered words you never heard.
They screamed inside my crazed brain. Only.
It could do nothing for you.
 
In time the petals wilted.
They blew away. And.
They became compost in someone else's garden.
The tough, fibrous stem withered.
I bit down hard to snap its grip on me. Then.
 
My teeth fell out.
Its thorns had burrowed into my cheeks.
They had implanted themselves permanently.
They were suckling on my softest tissues. And.
Not long after they sprouted tiny shoots.
 
They coiled their way down.
I still held the memory of your call. And.
The long stemmed beauty lodged next to it.
They cleaved unto the long roots curling down my neck.
My body held tight and listened. Hard.

Opened your plastic receptacle, the size of a jack-in-the-box. But instead
of gaudy stripes, your box is sober-suit blue, hymnal blue.
 
Tasted them. You've gained a statue's flavor, like licking the pyramids, or
kissing sandstone shoulders. I mean boulders.
 
Remarked to your box: ""REINCARNATION comes from roots meaning 'to
be made flesh again.'""
 
Stowed your box under my bed for a week to seed dreams in which you
advise me. (This didn't work.)
 
Opened the Babylonian Talmud at random. Read aloud to your gritty,
gray-white powder: ""There are three keys which the Holy One, blessed be
He, has not entrusted into the hands of any messenger. These are: the key
of rain, the key of birth, and the key of the resurrection of the dead.""
Worked myself up to watery eyes. Any intensity evaporated the instant I
stopped reading.
 
Tried to intuit your format, sift it from tides of void. Does shape play a
role? My watch ticked in an exaggerated way. Closed my eyes, sent forth
mental tendrils seeking the nothing of you. They curled back on them-

had fists that were often clenched, his face set like
an old man whose life had been so hard,
 
it hardened him. But the man's hands opened to let
more of the world in. He sent the funniest
 
cards to family and friends at Christmas, laid down
cable so others could connect. Yet, he lived
 
alone, kept to himself much of the time, so when
his sister found his body, he'd been gone
 
a good while. He died young at fifty-seven, without
fuss or bother. No sitting by the bedside
 
or feeding him soup. He just laid himself down like
a trunk line and let the signal pass through.

I'm just an assistant with the Vanishing Act.
My spangled wand points out the disappeared.
It's only a poor thing made of words, and lacks
the illusive power to light the darkling year.
 
Not prophecy, not elegy, but fact:
the thing that's gone is never coming back.
 
Late or soon a guttering silence will ring down
a curtain like woven smoke on thickening air.
The audience will strain to see what's there,
the old magician nowhere to be found.
 
For now, I wear a costume and dance obliquely.
The applause you hear is not for me, its rabid sound
like angry rain—as one by one the known forms cease to be:
childhood, the farm, the river, forested ground;
the tiger and the condor, the whale, the honeybee;
the village, the book, the lantern. Then you. Then me.

                ","
Last night, I went to a gay bar
with a man I love a little.
After dinner, we had a drink.
We sat in the far-back of the big backyard
and he asked, What will we do when this place closes?
I don't think it's going anywhere any time soon, I said,
though the crowd was slow for a Saturday,
and he said—Yes, but one day. Where will we go?
He walked me the half-block home
and kissed me goodnight on my stoop—
properly: not too quick, close enough
our stomachs pressed together
in a second sort of kiss.
I live next to a bar that's not a gay bar
—we just call those bars, I guess—
and because it is popular
and because I live on a busy street,
there are always people who aren't queer people
on the sidewalk on weekend nights.
Just people, I guess.
They were there last night.
As I kissed this man I was aware of them watching
and of myself wondering whether or not they were just.
But I didn't let myself feel scared, I kissed him
exactly as I wanted to, as I would have without an audience,
because I decided many years ago to refuse this fear—
an act of resistance. I left
the idea of hate out on the stoop and went inside,
to sleep, early and drunk and happy.
While I slept, a man went to a gay club
with two guns and killed forty-nine people.
Today in an interview, his father said he had been disturbed
recently by the sight of two men kissing.
What a strange power to be cursed with:
for the proof of men's desire to move men to violence.
What's a single kiss? I've had kisses
no one has ever known about, so many
kisses without consequence—
but there is a place you can't outrun,
whoever you are.
There will be a time when.
It might be a bullet, suddenly.
The sound of it. Many.
One man, two guns, fifty dead—
Two men kissing. Last night
I can't get away from, imagining it, them,
the people there to dance and laugh and drink,
who didn't believe they'd die, who couldn't have.
How else can you have a good time?
How else can you live?
There must have been two men kissing
for the first time last night, and for the last,
and two women, too, and two people who were neither.
Brown people, which cannot be a coincidence in this country
which is a racist country, which is gun country.
Today I'm thinking of the Bernie Boston photograph
Flower Power, of the Vietnam protestor placing carnations
in the rifles of the National Guard,
and wishing for a gesture as queer and simple.
The protester in the photo was gay, you know,
he went by Hibiscus and died of AIDS,
which I am also thinking about today because
(the government's response to) AIDS was a hate crime.
Now we have a president who names us,
the big and imperfectly lettered us, and here we are
getting kissed on stoops, getting married some of us,
some of us getting killed.
We must love one another whether or not we die.
Love can't block a bullet
but neither can it be shot down,
and love is, for the most part, what makes us—
in Orlando and in Brooklyn and in Kabul.
We will be everywhere, always;
there's nowhere else for us, or you, to go.
Anywhere you run in this world, love will be there to greet you.
Around any corner, there might be two men. Kissing.

The story goes from in a rainfall
to sister walking a field
browned autumn. And when she arrives
winter has come, so the old man
rises from his chair, picks up
matches, pipes and tools, and
walks out to begin again.
 
The sculptures grow by the day,
birds in ice, recognizable
eagles, a bear who began
as a man in a moment of dance.
He does this in ice, all
winter carving at dawn,
carving at dusk.
 
And sister after walking a field
browned autumn, arrives, watches
from the east window, waits,
goes out to him in spring,
taps him on the shoulder
and points to the pools
of water he's standing over.

wave in clear salt water,
in pink-tinted water.

as the Governor leaves Hispaniola in chains.

He would have been here.I swear he would. The silence feels oppressive now.I dig for a scuffed ball and throw it up, shoulder high,but let it fall. A natural hitter, my father said, holdingmy hands. I grip the tar-stained handle. Tears blurthe wall that's so far away it looks warped. I aimfor marrow deep inside, April hungry for the kill.

I stand in line. The woman ahead of me, blowzy-haired and angry, is told that grace is the act of restraint and road-kill is not a sport. She can choose to wait or test the judgment at another entrance. I know that morality, penance, a kind heart don't matter, nor the faith I embraced or didn't, the people I saved. I know the key is where I land on the scale of commitment.Earnhardt, Sr., died for the game, and got in. Many ancient Egyptians buried juggling balls with them, as though endless practice and craft were their gifts to the next world. They entered. I ask if I can peek in, maybe stand on the edge and look into the vast canyon of pits, arenas, fields, fairways, pools, rings, tables, tracks, courts, beaches, forests, mountainswhere war is forbidden. Here is what I bring for review: a nasty fastball, a runner-up ring, individual initiative, a contrary attitude, the heart of a poet. I bring a willingness to run like an outlaw, honor the Greeks and Makahiki, invent new games, practice past dusk, play on the second squad, and keep score until I can get in the game with eternity left on the clock. I hope it is enough.

Wehaven't. But when I read about not-there.org and saw its flashy graphics,I wasn't thinking about how women are not-there-yet, metaphorically, I just thought about women who are really not there, women and girls whokeep disappearing (not from magazines, who don't make news in Manhattan)like they've evaporated, like illusions, hundreds in Juárez, twelve hundred missing and murdered Native women across Canada. The hands of men.Now you see her. Not. Not-there. Not here, either,or anywhere. Maybe only part of the problem is the predatory perpetrator-prestidigitator who more often than not knows her, knows how to keep herquiet, who may claim to love her, even, maybe getting even—or the serialrapist-killer in the bushes who bushwhacks her in the dark. You're always safe,says the forensic psychiatrist, unless a monster happens to show up, andthen you're not. Not-there. Maybe a lonely mandible, maxilla, fibula, or ulna shows up, or a bagged body gets dragged from the river. Or not.

After a while the 500-year-old village became a secret,carved into the wall of the forest where it met the Pacific,eleven long houses and their racks of drying fish, theirdogs. No roads to this town, only boats and the memory ofboaters. Blankets made from woodpecker feathers, cattailfluff, cedar bark and dog hair woven into a plaid pattern.At least that's what I remember of the museum's diorama.When the mud came down the mountain and covered the village, no one had lived there for years. It was a boaterwho remembered, after a while, that the village was gone,and also that it had once existed. Archaeologists broughtgarden hoses to wash the mud off and hooked the hoses upto the sea. Some of what had been preserved in the mudwas destroyed that day by the water pressure, and then latermost else was ruined by the wind and rain, but at least fora few weeks they could hold the bones in their hands.

You’re right. I meant “midst,” not “mist.”
I don’t know what I was stinking,

Flue. Then no stepping nude
into the shower, no mist turning
the bathroom mirror into frosted glass
where my face would float
coldly in the oval. Picture a caveman
encased in ice. Good. I like how
your mind works, how your eyes
inside your mind works, and your actual eyes
reading this, their icy precision, nothing
slips by them. Even now I can feel you
hovering silently above these lines,
hawkish, Godlike, each period
a lone figure kneeling in the snow.
That’s too solemn. I would like to send
search parties and rescue choppers
to every period ever printed.
I would like to apologize to my wife
for not showering on Monday and Tuesday.
I was stinking. I was simultaneously
numb and needled with anxiety,
in the midst of a depressive episode.
Although “mist” would work too,
metaphorically speaking, in the mist of,
in the fog of, this gray haze that followed me
relentlessly from room to room
until every red bell inside my head
was wrong. Rung.

I speak of burying everyday fear to secure the fear of an instant. The purest loss. But who’ll say: you don’t cry anymore at night? Because madness is also a lie. Like night. Like death.

                    After the Deindustrialization of America, My Father Enters Television Repair
                ","
My hands hold, my father’s older the wires–
picture rolls once, then steadies… an English castle!
A voice-over drones about Edward I,
who, to subdue the Welsh, built castles.
Some sixty years, dozens of engineers, the masses
conscripted from the villages.
 
My father moves on to a Zenith
with a bad tuner. TVs interest him, not English
with their damp, historical programming.

Here there were Indians, mound builders.
Here, an English fort, a few farmers.
And here the industrialist settled his ass,
John Ford on the river dredging sand
for making glass. Plate glass.
(Why should America buy from Europe?)
Some half dozen years, German engineers, and hundreds of Slavic peasants.
 
Grandfather sat on his samovar
warming himself and making excuses,
but finally, he set off.
Got a room, became a shoveler.
Got a wife, a company house.
Ford City: a valley filling with properties.
 
No one got along–
Not Labor and Capital, not Germans and Slavs,
not husband and wives, for that matter.
 
                                                        *    *   *
 
Edward’s castles were ruins
by the fifteenth century. Not from Welsh armies,
but the rise of the middle class.
The towns around a castle thrived:
tailors, smithies, cobblers, coopers.
Drawing in the Welsh peasants.
And what with intermarriage and the rise of capitalism…
a castle grew obsolescent.
 
I turn off the set. My father hunts
cigarettes at the Kwik-Mart on the corner.
Overhead, my mother’s footsteps,
the tonk of bottles,
the scraping of plates.

During Eisenhower’s reign
my grandfather retired and mowed his lawn
until I took over. He primed the filter,
set the choke, then we took turns pulling
till the sputtering engine caught.
(“Somanabitch,” he spit)
And watched me as I mowed
back and forth for two dollars.
 
Once in the garage he showed me a scythe.
He mowed hay in the old country, and the women
would follow, raking it in windrows.
 
                                                        *    *   *
The factories today are mostly closed down,
or full of robots or far off in Asia.
Ford City lives through the mail:
compensation, a thin pension,
and, of course, Social Security.
 
I always drive along the factory, windows rolled down;
I want my kids in the back seat to see.
Seven or eight, probably pensioners, congregate
on the corner, each man dressed quite alike:
Sears jacket, cigarette, salt-and-pepper hair.
 
“Honk the horn,” my oldest begs.
He waves and waves zealously
until a man turns–a man
with my face, but full of sweetness now,
silence and clarity.

All night I hear the noise of water sobbing. All night I make night in me, I make the day that begins on my account, that sobs because day falls like water through night.
         All night I hear the voice of someone seeking me out. All night you abandon me slowly like the water that sobs slowly falling. All night I write luminous messages, messages of rain, all night someone checks for me and I check for someone.
         The noise of steps in the circle near this choleric light birthed from my insomnia. Steps of someone who no longer writhes, who no longer writes. All night someone holds back, then crosses the circle of bitter light.
         All night I drown in your eyes become my eyes. All night I prod myself on toward that squatter in the circle of my silence. All night I see something lurch toward my looking, something humid, contrived of silence launching the sound of someone sobbing.
         Absence blows grayly and night goes dense. Night, the shade of the eyelids of the dead, viscous night, exhaling some black oil that blows me forward and prompts me to search out an empty space without warmth, without cold. All night I flee from someone. I lead the chase, I lead the fugue. I sing a song of mourning. Black birds over black shrouds. My brain cries. Demented wind. I leave the tense and strained hand, I don’t want to know anything but this perpetual wailing, this clatter in the night, this delay, this infamy, this pursuit, this inexistence.
         All night I see that abandonment is me, that the sole sobbing voice is me. We can search with lanterns, cross the shadow’s lie. We can feel the heart thud in the thigh and water subside in the archaic site of the heart.
         All night I ask you why. All night you tell me no.

The wall of identical boxes into which
our Aunt Sticky sorted the daily mail
was at the far end of her dining room,
and from the private side looked like
a fancy wallpaper upon which peonies
pushed through a white wooden trellis,

stacked all the way to the ceiling.
I'd learned by then – I was a little boy –
that a thing can look like one thing
on one day and another on another,
depending on how you might be feeling.
There were times when we were there,

A mourner must shun vanity during shiva, focusing inward
but as a child I wondered if this were to avoid ghosts,
for don't the dead take their time leaving?
I'm of a generation where grandparents disappeared,
great aunts with European accents,
rarely an explanation provided to us children.
 
My mother died too young.
With a baby in arms I couldn't bear to fling
that dark cloth over the glass.
After all she had come back from the dead so often,
even the doctors could not explain it.
Each time I looked in a mirror my mother gazed back.
I could never tell if she were trying to tell me something
or to take the baby with her.

and snapped in two.
The sun behind the mountains
turned into an olive-green glow.
 
To niña Gloria this was home.
She continued to sell her bowl of lemons,
rubbing a cold, thin silver Christ
pocketed in her apron. Others
like Lito and Marvin played
soldiers in the ruins of a school,
running around mounds of bricks,
          shooting chickens and pigs.
 
No one knows exactly how
a light film of ash appeared
on everyone’s eyelids
          early in the morning
or how trout and mackerel plunged from the sky,
twitched, leaped through the streets.
 
Some say the skin of trees

Others believe the soapsuds
washed aside in rivers

One Monday morning, a rain fell
and the cemetery washed into the city.
Bones began to knock

bulls with their sad, busted eyes,
parrots that kept diving into creeks,
the dark swelling of the open ground

Instead, niña Gloria swept the ground,

military boots,
              twenty-five cents a pair,
reduced his words to a spit, a splutter
of broken sentences

clenched in the yellow jaw of a dog.

                ","
I wanted to have a poem and I was pregnant. I was very thin. As if I’d lived on air. A poet must be able to live on air, but a mother must not attempt it. My mother wanted me to buy a set of matching pots, Wearever aluminum, like the ones she had. They were heavy and had well fitting lids so my suppers wouldn’t burn. My husband wanted me to give dinner parties. John F. Kennedy was running for office.
 
I sensed danger. Kennedy wasn’t against the Bomb or for nuclear disarmament. I joined SANE at its inception. Also Concerned Scientists. I spoke with Linus Pauling and encouraged my husband to help his partner organize Physicians for Social Responsibility.
 
There was a baby in my belly. I wanted to write poems. I had a crazy idea that a woman could write a real novel, the kind that shook the world. I hallucinated that a woman could be a poet, but she would have to be free. I couldn’t imagine that freedom for myself even though I could see it in Isla Negra when I followed Pablo Neruda. I could see it in the way he walked. Even if he were walking inside a dictatorship, among guns, soldiers and spies, there was nothing between him and his vision. Anything he saw, he was able to take into himself–there was no sight, no image, no vision to which he didn’t feel entitled. In his heart, everything–everything–belonged to him. Pablo Neruda was–more than anything–a poet, and so he was an entitled man.
 
I was a woman and entitled to nothing. I had nothing except a husband, a rented house, a set of pots, living room furniture, a frenzy of obligations, credit cards, anxious relatives, too many acquaintances, a gift of future diaper service, two telephones, no time to read, a plastic wrapped cookbook of recipes gleaned from the pages of the New York Times, and a hunger, a terrible hunger for the unimaginable, unlimited freedom of being a poet, and a baby in my belly.
 
I would have called Pablo long distance if I had the courage, if I had the ability to speak Spanish fluently, if we had ever talked about real things. But, what would a man know about a baby in the belly? And what did it matter if there were to be one poet more or less in the world when so many in his country were dying?
 
I woke up one morning and thought–I can’t have this child. My husband said, “You’ll have to get a job after it’s born so we can buy a house. You’ll need an advanced degree so you can do something.” I thought, I can’t. I have to write poems. My mother found a crib. Someone painted it white. A friend sent a pastel mobile with tame wood animals. I thought about blue curtains, making bedspreads, and abortions.
 
Pablo was silent. He was walking so far from me, I couldn’t hear him. My husband objected to donating more free medical care to the Black Panthers. I tried to make dolmades from scratch and located grape leaves preserved in brine at the Boys’ Market twenty miles away. I organized a write-in campaign for peace to challenge JFK. My husband thought it would be nice to have teatime with the children and romantic dinners by ourselves. The new formula bottles lined up on the sink like tiny bombs. The U.S. was pursuing over ground testing; I was afraid the radiation would cross the milk barrier. I had a poem in me howling for real life but no language to write in. The fog came in thick, flapping about my feet like blankets unraveling. I became afraid to have a daughter.
 
I called Pablo Neruda in the middle of the night as he walked underwater by Isla Negra. He moved like a dream porpoise. He seemed pregnant with words. They came out of his penis in long miraculous strings. The sea creatures quivered with joy. I said, “Pablo, I want to know how to bear the child in my belly onto this bed of uranium and I want to know if a woman can a be a poet.” He was large as a whale. He drank the sea and spouted it in glistening odes, black and shiny. I said, “I can’t have this child,” and he laughed as if he had never done anything but carry and birth children.
 
So I packed my little bag as if I were going to the hospital and I left a note and the Wearever pots and sterilized nipples upon the glass missiles, and took the cradle board than an American Indian friend had given me for the baby and that had made my husband snort– “You’re not going to carry the thing on your back, are you?” I took some money, the car, some books, paper and pens, my walking shoes, an unwieldly IBM electric typewriter, my pregnant belly and a dozen cloth diapers, and I went out.
 
I knew how to carry a baby and how to carry a poem and I would learn how to have a baby and even how to have a poem. I would have enough milk for both. I would learn how to walk with them. But I didn’t know, and I didn’t want to know, how to have a husband and a matched set of Wearever pots.

The same desolate luxury,
Each ashamed of the same things:
Innocence and privacy. I'd lug
Home the paper bags, doing
Bank-balance math and counting days.

What woke to war in me those years
When my daughter had first grown into
A solid self-centered self? I’d watch her
Sit at the table—well, not quite sit,
More like stand on one leg while
The other knee hovered just over the chair.
She wouldn't lower herself, as if
There might be a fire, or a great black
Blizzard of waves let loose in the kitchen,
And she'd need to make her escape. No,
She'd trust no one but herself, her own
New lean always jittering legs to carry her—
Where exactly? Where would a child go?
To there. There alone. She'd rest one elbow
On the table—the opposite one to the bent leg
Skimming the solid expensive tasteful chair.
And even though we were together, her eyes
Would go half-dome, shades dropped
Like a screen at some cinema the old aren't
Let into. I thought I'd have more time! I thought
My body would have taken longer going
About the inevitable feat of repelling her,
But now, I could see even in what food
She left untouched, food I'd bought and made
And all but ferried to her lips, I could see
How it smacked of all that had grown slack
And loose in me. Her other arm
Would wave the fork around just above
The surface of the plate, casting about
For the least possible morsel, the tiniest
Grain of unseasoned rice. She'd dip
Into the food like one of those shoddy
Metal claws poised over a valley of rubber
Bouncing balls, the kind that lifts nothing
Or next to nothing and drops it in the chute.
The narrow untouched hips. The shoulders
Still so naïve as to stand squared, erect,
Impervious facing the window open
Onto the darkening dusk.

The Inside Out Mermaid is fine with letting it all hang out–veins, muscles, the bits of fat at her belly, her small gray spleen. At first her lover loves it–with her organs on the outside, she's the ultimate open book. He can pump her lungs like two bellows and make her gasp; ask her difficult questions and study the synapses firing in her brain as she answers to see if she's lying; poke a pleasure center in the frontal lobe and watch her squirm. No need for bouquets or sad stories about his childhood. He just plucks a pulmonary vein and watches the left ventricle flounder. But before long, she starts to sense that her lover, like all the others before him, is getting restless. This is when she starts showing them her collections–the basket of keys from all over the world, the box of zippers with teeth of every imaginable size–all chosen to convey a sense of openness. As a last resort, she’ll even read out loud the entries from her diary about him to him. But eventually he’ll become convinced she’s hiding things from him and she is. Her perfect skin. Her long black hair. Her red mouth, never chapped from exposure to sun or wind, how she secretly loves that he can’t touch her here or here.

I go in afterwards with paper towels to mop the droplets–I know there’ll be water all over–but the room is bone dry. Maybe this time things will be different. I hide the home movies in case they ask for them.

Sunday, awake with this headache. I pull apart the evening with a fork. White
clot behind the eyes.
 
 
Someone once told me, before and after is just another false binary. The
warmed-over bones of January. I had no passport. Beneath the stove, two mice
made a paradise out of a button of peanut butter.
 
 
Suffering operates by its own logic. Its gropings and reversals. Ample, in ways
that are exquisite. And how it leaves—not unlike how it arrives, without clear
notice.
 
 
These days, I've had my fill of Chinatown and its wet markets. Gutted fish.
Overcooked chattering. The stench making me look hard at everything.
 
 
Summer mornings before the heat has moved in. Joy has been buried in me
overnight, but builds in the early hours. My attention elastic.
 
 
The babbling streets of Causeway Bay, out of which the sharp taste of the city
emerges. Nothing can stay dry here. The dark cherries of eyes come and go,
as they please.
 
 
Let there be no more braiding of words. I want a spare mouth.
 
 
My father taught me wherever you are, always be looking for a way out: this
opening or that one. Or a question. Sharp enough to slice a hole for you to slip
through.
 
 
Long car trips where I sat in the back of our family's used Nissan. The stale
odor of plush seats and sun-warmed cola. My parents' and my words do not
touch. I grow adept at tunneling inward, a habit I have yet to let go of.
 
 
I am protective of what eyes cannot pry open. The unannounced. The infinite
places within language to hide.
 
 
A Zen priest once told me that without snagging on a storyline, the body can
only take loss for ninety seconds. The physical body has its limits, is what I
heard. The imagination can break through them.
 
 
Boiled peanuts. Leather of daybreak. Cotton thinning out into thread. Dried
vomit. Ice water from the spigot. The sacred and profane share a border. In the
desert, small droppings of unknown origin.
 
 
Even when I was young, I loved peering at faces in films. The pleasure of
watching and of not being watched.
 
 
Black koi fish open their mouths at the skin of the pond for oxygen. At the edge
of the water, I hold two lines from Ikkyū in my mouth. Make my way slowly.
 
 
Nights when I shared a bed in a small room. Another’s body to the left, hooked
by a heavy dream.
 
 
Funny, the way we come to understand a place by wanting to escape it.
 
 
I can shake out the imprint of my body on the sheets each morning. But the
mind–the mind is a different matter.

Four noodle shops on East Broadway release their belches collectively.

Here, there's no logic to melons and spring onions exchanging hands.
No rhythm to men's briefs clothes-pinned to the fire escape.
 
Retirees beneath the Manhattan Bridge leak hearsay.

Faces knotted, bangs softened with grease.

Who’s keeping count of what’s given against what’s stolen?
 
There's nothing I can't trace back to my coarse immigrant blood.

orange and acidic by a coal mine. How can
you not fear humanity, want to lick the creek

say: Don’t die. Even when silvery fish after fish

something singing? The truth is: I don’t know.
But sometimes, I swear I hear it, the wound closing

pain, can still marvel at how the dog runs straight

Anthem. If you think about it, it’s not a good

Once, I sang it at homecoming and threw
even the tenacious high school band off key.
But the song didn’t mean anything, just a call
to the field, something to get through before
the pummeling of youth. And what of the stanzas
we never sing, the third that mentions “no refuge
could save the hireling and the slave”? Perhaps,
the truth is, every song of this country
has an unsung third stanza, something brutal
snaking underneath us as we blindly sing
the high notes with a beer sloshing in the stands
hoping our team wins. Don’t get me wrong, I do
like the flag, how it undulates in the wind
like water, elemental, and best when it’s humbled,
brought to its knees, clung to by someone who
has lost everything, when it’s not a weapon,
when it flickers, when it folds up so perfectly
you can keep it until it’s needed, until you can
love it again, until the song in your mouth feels
like sustenance, a song where the notes are sung

the Red River Gorge, the fistful of land left
unpoisoned, that song that’s our birthright,
that’s sung in silence when it’s too hard to go on,

There is a river under this poem.
It flows blue and icy
And carries these lines down the page.
Somewhere beneath its surface
Lying chained to the silt
Harry holds his breath
And slowly files
His fingernails into moons.
He wonders who still waits at the dock
If the breasts of those young girls
Have developed since he sank.
He thinks of his parents
Of listening to the tumblers
Of his mother's womb
Of escaping upward out of puberty
Out of the pupils in his father's eyes
And those hot Wisconsin fields.
He dreams of escaping
From this poem
Of cracking the combinations
To his own body
And those warm young safes
Of every girl on the dock.
Jiggling his chains
Harry scares a carp that circles
And nibbles at his feet.
He feels the blue rush of the current
Sweeping across his body
Stripping his chains of their rust
Until each link softens
And glows like a tiny eel.
And Harry decides to ascend.
He slips with the water
Through his chains
And climbing over and over
His own air bubbles
He waves to the fish
To his chains glittering
And squirming in the silt.

Of seaweed for the young girls
on the dock. Rising
He bursts the surface of this poem.

Near the camp was a river

that will one day wake us in vain

while he was sitting in the shade
ironing his clothes
the blue jacket sagging over his shoulders
 
I paid no attention to the road
or the three steps
and didn't notice the carpet
 
I don't remember who was it that said
to me or to another
""When you grow up poetry will become your house""
 
The dust that eats the memories
always distances those folks
 
yet their chairs appear from afar,
from behind the hills and over the houses,
to hang in an air of summer and holm oak,
those shaded chairs that reach the heart
on shoulders topped
with five flowers
 
Which flowers are speech
which flowers are silence?
 
And I can't remember
whether it was my uncle who stood at the door,
whether we had palm and lotus trees
in our house in Karameh,
 
whether my mother
who gave birth to me on the shelf
was folding our clothes behind our father's back
so he could sleep
 
The watchdogs used to cry from the heat,
and poetry, Husseini of Jerusalem,
and Khidr the mystic were all in our house
as was my uncle who came from a pond
within Hebron's walls
 
Twenty years would pass before a photo could tell us
we have grown older
and that's that
 
My father used to discompose his friends
with his days, and women
with the thread of seduction in his voice
as he would sprinkle chatter in their rivers
while walking about here or there with a lilt,
he'd let his days fall off him
and let others gather them as he walked
on gold that came only for him
 
And I can't remember:
in our courtyard there were holm oaks,
a fountain, a tiled floor by a huge door,
we were confused and in a hurry
 
The closet that faced us in the second room
had a mirror
the mirror we now seek
 
And my father was standing alone in the hall that led
the stairs to the roof
thanking his days
or preparing for Wednesday's nap
or Thursday's morning
as he left, among the things he'd leave, the water can
full of water
while around his chairs our Saturdays rose
 
My father didn't want too much from life:
a house, five boys

with the bed breathing.

2  The Miniature Bed
A miniature bed, and in it two tiny people
not sleeping, not able to sleep because
a small lie has flowered between them,
fragile as a new, white crocus.
The miniature bed holds them like a miniature boat
making its slow, true course to morning.
These tiny people, thoughts thrumming like mice,
are quiet as the lie blooms over them
in the night, fanning its moth petals,
becoming to them like a moon hovering
over their bed, a moon they might almost touch
with their miniature hands, if they weren't certain
that one wrong gesture might break
the spindles of their small world, if their hearts
were not drops of trembling quicksilver,
if they were brave, if they could see
that small is no smaller than big, that thimbles
are deep as oceans for any god, they might even
touch each other then, opening the dark,
like a match, the sun's flaring.     
3  Harvest
 
The fields are a book of uses.
Near the house
a combine takes the corn down
in long rows.
Dust rises up and replaces itself.
A quick net of starlings
drops to the furrows
and sunshine pours like polished grain
onto the feeding earth,
this country.
 
In the kitchen, milk streams
from the gallon
thin and fresh as luck.
We flourish.
All around us, things flourish.
Cows strain the fence with their abundance.
The herd makes a sound like swelling.
 
Out in the cut field
birds clean the fallen cobs
into sets of teeth.     
4  Sonnet for Lost Teeth
 
The combines were tearing off the field’s clothes.
It was August, haying season. My tooth
was loose, a snag in the clam of my mouth.
I worked it like a pearl. I'd been out of school
for sixty days. In the sweat of the barn
I watched him shoot the calf in the head.
He wiped the hide gently, like cleaning his glasses.
Overnight, I grew a beard so I wouldn't
have to get married. I let my feet go black
from burned grasses. It never gets easier
he said, kicking straw over the blood patch.
She went down so quiet it was almost
sad. Later, when my tooth fell out, I buried it
under my pillow and it grew into money.     
5  Talisman
 
Waiting for the school bus you find
the femur of a baby animal
on the ground. You carry
that femur in your pocket
the entire morning and touch it
secretly through the cloth.
When the teacher asks
a question you don't raise
your hand but quietly
wrap your fingers around
the thin shape, that bone
without a mother.     
6  On Waking
 
Half of everything is invisible.
A river drifts below the river.
A gesture lost in the body.
Wind moves through the open
windows of the trees.
 
Beyond the day, another day.
 
Dreamed I was drowning
my mother's silk laundry
in the river,
kneeling on the wet rocks.
Back and forth I drowned it
in the gray clouds...     
7  Eros
 
Each year fish run the green vein of the river.
The bones of skunks lie buried in the riverbank
upside down, waiting for rain.
 
From a fragment of a Greek statue
you can tell the posture of the whole god.
A skeleton has the same intelligence.
 
So that when a girl discovers it,
loosened by summer rain, surfaced
like a white instrument in the grass,
she suddenly knows how to take it up
and shake the strange rhythms from it like castanets.     
8  A Childhood
 
The horse had been beaten and flies
crawled excited on the beat marks.
He held still in the sunblazed pasture.
For a few minutes I stood at the wire fence.
He was aware of me, but he did not turn—
except his eye, slightly. He listened
through the many ears of the grasses.
A jay made a hole in the air with its cry.
Everywhere, invisible as heat, the gods
married each other and went to war.
The excitement of it vibrated in the flies.
As if we both were standing still
inside some greater, more violent motion.

awkward parties with spin the bottle and seven

strung on repurposed vintage drying racks
and fat clay pots of kombucha and curdling hops.
Personally I've never recovered from the sex-shaped
void left in those closets by all the groping
that should have occurred to me but didn't:
right under my nose kids my age were creeping
into adulthood one clammy, trembling palm
on one breast at a time. There was also
the horror of not being chosen in gym.
It is conceivable that learning intricately
how to butcher an entire hog
and render every morsel might give one
a feeling of mastery one lacked in childhood.It is the greatest immaturity to believe sufferingentitles you to something someone wiser
and grayer than I once said.
But in those basements and carpools and
playgrounds as I assassinated one by one
clandestinely my torturers
abandoning their foul normal
bodies to compost the astonishing
tedium of the wending suburban lanes,
I was transubstantiating to supernal
fame and beauty and such eerie genius
that entire books were written about my
books. In fact it takes a long time to realize
your suffering is of very little consequence
to anyone but you. And by that time the future
is already happening and you're pickling okra
and starfruit and foraging for morels in urban forests
and suspending artisan mozzarella in little wet nets
and crafting small-batch, nitrite-free data

children, which you swore in a million
billion years you would never do.

         For example, I love being in the woods felling and bucking hardwood trees, stacking and covering the blocks, then a year or two later, hauling them to the woodshed where I stack them again, and split them all winter long into the right size for the weather—then bring them into the house.

Everyone wants to write about god
but no one wants to imagine their god
 
as the finger trembling inside a grenade
pin’s ring or the red vine of blood coughed into a child’s palm
 
while they cradle the head of a dying parent.
Few things are more dangerous than a man
 
who is capable of dividing himself into several men,
each of them with a unique river of desire
 
on their tongues. It is also magic to pray for a daughter
and find yourself with an endless march of boys
 
who all have the smile of a motherfucker who wronged you
and never apologized. No one wants to imagine their god
 
as the knuckles cracking on a father watching their son
picking a good switch from the tree and certainly
 
no one wants to imagine their god as the tree.
Enough with the foolishness of hope and how it bruises
 
the walls of a home where two people sit, stubbornly in love
with the idea of staying. If one must pray, I imagine
 
it is most worthwhile to pray towards endings.
The only difference between sunsets and funerals
 
is whether or not a town mistakes the howls
of a crying woman for madness.

about the boundaries of this clearing

the compost bucket unwashed to rescue
a single tattered wing from under the winter

I wanted to write an epic about suffering,
but when I found a tendril
of her hair among the ruins
of her mud house,
I found my epic there.2
I didn’t sleep last night.
As if the night
were hiding in the morning coffee.3
Her life is a game of snakes and ladders
sent relentlessly back to square one,
but whose life isn’t? She takes a breath
and throws the dice again.4
The city glitters below
the airplane window, not because
of the bones and skulls scattered
under the sun, but the view
through the frosted breather hole.5
She died, and time changed
for those she loved most,
but her watch kept ticking.6
A god carried the burdens
until the weight persuaded him
to transfer them to man — 
the new suffering god.7
The map of Iraq looks like a mitten,
and so does the map of Michigan — 
a match I made by chance.8
If you can’t save people,
at least don’t hate them.9
Her bubbling annoys me — 
can’t understand a word she says.
So what if I toss her from the aquarium?
So what if I spill her new world
with this nasty immigrant fish!10
The city’s innumerable lights
turning on and off remind us
we are born to arrive,
as we are born to leave.11
The handkerchiefs are theirs,
but the tears are ours.12
Women running barefoot.
Behind them, stars falling from the sky.13
So strange,
in my dream of us,
you were also a dream.14
He said to me: You are in my eyes.
Now when he sleeps,
his eyelids cover me.15

for immortality,
for only in death could he be certain
of seeing his friend Enkidu again.16
Some say love means
putting all your eggs
in one basket.
If they all break,
can the basket remain intact?17
The homeless are not afraid
to miss something.
What passes through their eyes
is how the clouds pass over the rushing cars,
the way pigeons miss some of the seeds
on the road and move away.
Yet only they know
what it means to have a home
and to return to it.18
The wind and rain
don’t discriminate
in buffeting us.
We are equal
in the eyes of the storm.19
When I was broken into fragments,
you puzzled me
back together
piece by piece.
I no longer fear
being broken
in any moment.20
Freezing in the mountains
without blankets or food,
and all they heard wasno news is good news.21
Their stories didn’t kill me
but I would die if I didn’t
tell them to you.22
Before killing them
they collected their personal effects.
Their cell phones are all ringing
in the box.23
We are not upset when
the grass dies. We know
it will come back
in a season or two.
The dead don’t come back
but they appear every time
in the greenness of the grass.24
If yearning encircles us,
what does it portend?
That a circle has no beginning
and no end?

right here, in and out of season,
because even just saying the names gives me pleasure,
as does saying your name.
I’m not alone with my passion — my whole family,

He was so good to me, as was the late-summer freestone
I picked as I walked back through the orchard

which were nothing like the Gates of Hell.

I can still smell that single peach, which was profusely
low-hanging, it was the definition of low-hanging,
it fell into my hands, as you did — 
or perhaps as I did into yours — 
but that was months ago.
When I walked past the stands yesterday,
on what should have been the first day of spring,
all produce had been covered with heavy blankets
to keep it warm, to mitigate harm.

Wheal Emma and Brookwood are abandoned copper mines whose remains are located near Buckfastleigh, within the Dartmoor National Park, an area with a long history of widespread industrial activity. From this one locality, in the second half of the nineteenth century, more than thirty thousand tons of copper ore were raised, processed, and shipped for smelting. In 1859, in order to stabilize and increase the power supply, Wheal Emma Leat (a fifteen-mile-long channel) was cut across moorland and around woodland valleys to transport water from the River Swincombe and to feed the mines by supplementing the Mardle, a tributary of the Dart. Some of this now empty moorland waterway can be walked today on Dartmoor. I am grateful to Kevin and Donna Cox, owners of the Brook Manor estate, for showing my collaborator, Ignacio Acosta, and me over the remains of mine workings on their land.

Widening the plug doorway
on the bob wall left no
surface evidence. The Mardle
has a floodplain fair and wide.
Material would have been
trammed directly, although
blacked ochreous water flows
freely from the collapsed
portal. Humphrey kept Kevin
back when we went into
the near horizontal dark adit
stooped at the panic shaft.
In Brook Wood at the combe
head is a small killas quarry
predating all three setts.
Rent was paid to the Brook Wood
adventurers. Three areas of
dumping partially covered
this crumbled masonry within
woodland of varying density
just south of the tarmac road.
Yet a leat is depicted on the
1886 OS map channeled entirely
in a raised wooden aqueduct.

Then buildings fall into decay
where ivy and tree growth
have taken hold. The silted channel
follows the contour round hills
and combes using the best-fit
method to Wheal Emma sett.
Whereas conifer scrub and dense
patches of rhododendron
are seen quite late in the sequence.
All 99 stations were used and
having passed over the wheel
water may have been diverted.
The long wheelhouse sides are not
straight but slightly kinked to provide
for a dished 60-ft wheel
over an arched tailrace exit
at floor level. In this same evening
were those people engaged to feast
on roast beef and strong ale nearby.
Within the valley of the holy brook
the mines are situated near
Buckfastleigh, crushed ores are hauled
for the South Wales copper smelters,
Alfred Jenkin their agent in Cornwall.
Over and over had they been
in the heaven of expectation
finding the ore ground pitched eastward;
those who gambled their lives in swift
currents and dark treacherous pools.
Granting two properties as
one sett at a royalty of 1/24
together with fine machinery,
wheels, a beam engine, and water
privileges. One hundred and twenty-
five workers being then separated
only by a small transverse valley.
The flat rods moved off so quietly
that those not looking were unconscious
of their being in motion. Steam was
employed only at limited scale.
Emma, 116 fathoms below adit,
pumping backed-up water for life itself:
men cutting lode in fume- and dust-ridden air
or crushing with hand tools, spalling, cobbing,
came our tramroad to harbor direct
in Totnes and thence by sea to Neath — 
no more windlass or horse-whim turning.
What you see here is the dressing floor.
Their Phoenician purple dye — 
their copper with fifteen percent
Cornish tin. Remember when
a solid solution of
metal elements was defined
by ecstatic bonding.
Water poured over its surface
producing hydrogen gas.
The new material is
stable and ready for use
but scaled-up production
could fuel cannibal drones.

We love the color and
the stillness. Nothing would
live in this water now
at the base of a spoil heap
two stories high. Worm casts
and broadly scattered pits
are laminated onto a
non-conductive substrate.
This is the green pool:
a water soak away
made from glass epoxy.
They are brown and green
like uneven flat loaves
and the museum label
reads tortas de cobre.
Moss grows on anything
like black flame retardant
mechanically supports and
electrically connects — 
the fenced-off shaft
protecting the river
from what leaches out
between sea-borne traders.
At these horizons the levels were
extended over 330 fathoms.
Small groups of self-employed
miners and their families
continued to migrate. Here was
alluvial gold mixed with
sand and gravel, producing
more than 14 heads of stamps were
capable of crushing. Composed
of quartz, peach, and gossan with black
and yellow copper letting down
a stream of mineralized water.
For in much of this section
the leat had been cut from
solid rock. A stone-lined sluice
is just visible. 4,000 shares
on the cost book system,
streamworks in eluvial ground,
5 shillings each deposit. Nothing
but a washing strake such as
we use, commodified and priced
both minerals since the Bronze Age
in West Devon, in Cornwall
beneath a layer of black sand.
An adit is also brought home
to the spot from below: narrow
tailings in steep profile cast
every shovel full as it rises
into a tye. £40,000 worth
of copper ore from above
the 50-fathom level.
Water breaks up the soil, exposing
mere threads of land, linear strips
cut into channels called races
dug across the ground to be worked,
removing the overburden.

& maybe it’s my accent // unable to pronounce refrigrator
En español // refrigerador // As if our language was a child
who wet the bed from being tickled too much // & if we only
speak one language // can we name her Joy // Dear Mother
I’ve read the credit report // & America fiscally sponsored the
Civil War in El Salvador // where men had genitals cut off
stuffed into their mouths // their heads decapitated & placed
between their legs // Tio saw all his friends // students slumped
on chain link fences // after marching outside the university
As a child // I never thought how difficult it must’ve been to
pick the heads of daisies with me // by the swimming pool
Each petal pulled // I’d recite // he loves me // he loves me not
God must // in the most bloated nights // the fullest nights
God must’ve known // you’d follow me outside “heaven’s gates”
What an oxymoron // There must be a heaven that’s boundless &
unbridled // where we can seek asylum // Dear Mother // please
teach me how to hold the sorrow // without losing my arms

Caretakers — died in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, one after another. One didn’t show up because her husband was in prison. Most others watched the clock. Time breaks for the living eventually and they can walk out of doors. The handle of time’s door is hot for the dying. What use is a door if you can’t exit? A door that can’t be opened is called a wall. My father is on the other side of the wall. Tomatoes are ripening on the other side. I can see them through the window that also can’t be opened. A window that can’t be opened is just a see-through wall. Sometimes we’re on the inside like a plane. Most of the time, we’re on the outside like doggie day care. I don’t know if the tomatoes are the new form of his language or if they’re simply for eating. I can’t ask him  because on the other side, there are no words. All I can do is stare at the nameless bursting tomatoes and know they have to be enough.

Fish tap tap tap on the roof
Water rushes by through the living room and into the kitchen late
             night and look someone thought to do the dishes
A lamp is on in the other room
Two lamps
Lampreys swirl in a bucket from last night’s dream
I had wanted to dream about birds and all I got were these
             eels
Who could I call to ask what to do?
  •
Who could move the peonies back into the kitchen and who might
             change their water?
Other things get started
Peepers
Stuck in jelly
At the same time spring pushes up against the windows
             a green screen
And sleep
Pooled at the top of the stairs
Who could I call to make an appointment
             or swim?
Cows float in the bunch
Scraps of  brown paper
I learn to swim in the afternoon with everyone else my age
A sale of  Holsteins and Herefords
You can smell the detergent in the yard with
             the other flowers
When I woke up this morning the lights were already on in the
             clover
  •
Hunkered down on all fours to see it maybe press your nose
             up against it
Like rabbits
The bottoms of  her baby feet
My son’s hair is still gold and smells like wheat
The porch light sluiced through the mown grass so we would know
             where we were or were not
At home or away
Just upstream from a cell tower and a box of  Huggies
Who would scoop up the backyard and who flush out
             those rabbits?
The neighbors are already at it
Just upstream from a can of  Red Bull and a pollen allergy
The old mower used gasoline but this new one you just plug into a wall
Trims the edges
An orange extension cord crawls out from the dining room into
             the sun
The entire afternoon stacked up on the edge of
             the patio
  •
Dandelions with their heads chopped off and my mother’s one or
             other dog or is that a deer?
Deer file up to the window to look at you
A gardening problem in the suburbs
Deer pellets
Your little fingers opening an apple opening
             a star
Feeding it to a deer
The seeds inside were red watermelon seeds
A light sweat breaks out over the milk carton
Not only that but also fish piled up in the back of  a truck or slung into
             waxed bags
A silver leak
Where is everyone?
My kids slide inside their wet rooms asleep
A bag of Chinook a bag of
             Silverside?
Leaking onto a pile of ferns
  •
A light wash overflows this regular morning
Aspirin with codeine inside is nice and something to look forward
             to outside of a blank slate
The cool floors of grocery stores
The side of your cheek in the morning
             a fish cheek
Safeway is open ditto Fred Meyer
The fridge opens by itself and leaks something almost lettuce and
             almost milk
Just upstream from a pair of headphones and a Weight Watchers
Not only a light on in the refrigerator but a puddle lit from inside
A dragonfly drags through grass
             and trash
You don’t get to be the grass
That dragonfly probly isn’t even a dragonfly probly it’s a deerfly
Snapdragons!
I dreamt we started the whole day over from scratch
Poured that out onto the floor
  •
Not only static in the trees when I wake up but something whipped
             up into glossy foam
Chirrup-chirrup my tree makes syrup
             syrup so sweet
Upstream from a can of Aqua Net and a Pepsi
White twist ties
Just opened this morning
Skipping down the grandmother sidewalk without stepping on a
             crack
No one to catch it or hold it
No one to pull the light out of the rhododendrons by hand with
             their own hands
Mom calls from the dog run in the backyard
A minor threat
A dog floats by another dog
Put the coffee on I’ll be right in!
A wind from I-5 kicks up her green jogger and there she’s gone
Stuck in a tree
  •
No one to mow the backyard or the front even or take a message
The eels are male then female and back again
They swim under the couch and disappear
The sun goes on despite disappointing coverage and lower fees
Mom does her hair
What would you like to do with this pile of cell phones?
What would you like to eat?
The baby likes dogs and flowers
Bees in the lilac tree have something to say and say it without giving
             away the ending
A yellow retriever mix or black lab or roses
Royal Gold or Ruby Ruby
That lilac tree probly isn’t even a lilac tree probly it’s a bush
Press play
Her little fingers can’t yet work
             a button
  •
Not only a list of ants making its way from a crack in the concrete to
             a scrap in the sink
Flower Carpet Coral or Flower Carpet Pink
But milk in the ground
Babymeal
Something opens in the day and you
             step right through
The ants are interesting they stick together all in a line or a ring
             circling
The rings of  Saturn
Oh look someone picked up the tennis balls and miscellaneous toys
             before plugging in the mower
Or a spaniel or a boxer
No one to pick her up or hold her?
Blight was a word we never used as the roses took or they didn’t
The baby?
Fragrant Cloud Fragrant Plum
The grass is tennis-ball green
  •
But also that deerfly could have been a mosquito just outside the
             service area
I could finally get through to you to reach you!
The tips of its fingers
Paper or plastic?
If you want birds you might try a bird feeder
Just upstream from a gallon of  2% and a yellow pack of American
             Spirits
Stick on your mosquito body or yellow swimsuit
             and swim
But also the kids breathing inside their mammal rooms breathing
             water
Someone left the bougainvillea on all night ditto the humidifier
Same frequency as the rhoddy’s
You could hear it for a long time after
Their dream names Sharpied onto the sides of a white
             plastic bag
I could finally do that
No one has called my cell phone now for hours
  •
Cherry blossoms call to the surface of things that is
             their color
In contrast to almost everything else on the floor
My dream kids shit in buckets
Frogs try to get on them
Who will shoe their pretty little feet who will hold their hands?
This is the earth and sometimes the earth
             changes colors
Now I remember they were horses mulching the backyard
Who will polish their shiny little hooves?
Who will pick them flowers?
A regular morning
You nuzzled open a pile of cherries and there it was the thing we
             always wanted
Whatever that was
A chain link fence goes round and round
             like a song
They sleep standing up in a circle
  •
Dandelions pee in a corner of the yard a kind of Kodak
             yellow
Lamb’s Tongue ditto the Coltsfoot
My horse kids eat something off the ground I can’t quite make out
             some leather fruits and Oh’s
Nosing in the dark
Nosing inside of  holes
Lay their necks across my one neck
Just upstream from a microwave and a tub of  Cool Whip
Noses against the sliding glass door squeak a little at night that is
             their sound
Noses against visitors
Who will mow around their calves?
Mom said she wasn’t sure
Not one memory of a butterfly back there but horseflies somehow in
             the buck grass
Eat the roses
Dig a little hole and get into it
  •
What should I do with their withers and fetlocks what should I do
             with their dressage?
A parade is nice
I shoveled the backyard for a picnic but you could still smell it
The tomatoes almost took ditto
             the basil
Not only today but also tomorrow
Noses in the dark
Manure noses
The day curled up in a cup
A private life you can hear above the washer or was that the mower
             even now it’s two blocks away
Listening is yellow and green
Fish swim in cell phones
Speakers set up thoughtfully throughout the house did you
             notice that?
Skin wings on the back of another animal or person
Eating out a radio
  •
The day curled up in a corner
Butterfly static but harder to hear the closer you are to the window
             isn’t that odd?
Skateboards on the macadam
Switch heel kickflip via a Frontside 180
I couldn’t see the kids before they were born though they threw
             their voices
An earful of leaf  blowers
Then they were here
The day was moving off somewhere
             hard to see
The day was both
Curled up on the couch
At first I thought I could hear them through leaves and understory
             but then I wasn’t so sure
You both do and you don’t
More a davenport than anything else
Just upstream from a can of  lemon Pledge and some Gordon’s
  •
Did I tell you that I watered the cherry tree in the backyard ditto
             the crepe myrtle?
Is that what’s it called?
Talking to maple leaves makes for a nice morning if quiet
             at first and then loud
Day moves toward the door
A box fan instead of air conditioning
I can’t tell their voices apart
Across the dark green lawn something glows is that a glass of milk?
Kids curled up on the coating
An earwig floats by another earwig
The day listens to traffic moving off in two directions at once like
             standing in a spring shower
Flowers appear without warning
And whom do we have to thank for this delicious lunch?
These petits fours?
That one and only glass of milk?

For instance you walk through the room without
             looking up
The door opens out onto central air after all
Light a cigarette in there
Those Chinook and Silverside probly aren’t probly they’re Rainbow
             Trout and Organic Salmon
A spoonful of roe
No place to light your fingers
Or move them back and forth
For instance the phone keeps ringing in the other room
Beneath a tea cozy
Just upstream from a toilet cover and
             a Percocet
More a lilac than anything else
An ant floats by another ant
A lilac tree
But you don’t even know how to have fun anymore you don’t even
             like to do drugs
  •
Sidewalks glint in sun and trees newly opened oh shit I woke up
             with a tension headache!
Pear blossoms
They smell like semen
For instance I look forward to seeing you all day
No place to put our feet up or
             say anything
Blah blah blahblahblah
Quick let’s do it before the kids wake up!
For a long time I would cut the grass in the morning before
             it got too hot
For instance the basil burned ditto the oatmeal
Growing up I never considered a different kind of  life because we
             had television
It doesn’t seem that long ago
A swimming pool in the living room
White reverb
I used to take off fast but now I take off slow
  •
More a migraine than anything else
Something dull in the bushes is that a rabbit?
A dead squirrel whirligigs
             the light
That light was cling-free
For instance a Coke is nice and something to look forward to and
             you can do it by yourself
I think the day knows exactly what it’s doing
Opening a stuck window or collecting a small fee
But also you see something out the window I don’t see
Moss grows you can count on it
Morning dew scratched at the door then cantered away into what
             we’re not sure of
I filtered everything through rain and got what exactly
             more rain?
The good news is ferns
The good news is graffiti
Those peonies probly weren’t even peonies probly they’re dahlias
  •
But also the kids pick flowers if you let them
Some petals are soapy and blow down the street a quick and linty
             pink and white dream
As for TV there’s always perennials
As for day care there’s always the grass
A pile of nachos in the microwave
Just upstream from a car battery and a glass of SunnyD
Benadryl in the grass and grass insects tuning up the tardy afternoon a
             twitchy kickstart
Her sneeze in the puffed-out dandelions his little cough someplace
             else altogether
It’s time for lunch
It’s time for the sun
Just because you carry something from one day to the next it doesn’t
             make all days the same
Everybody out of  the pool!
The regular skimmers are brightly colored and constant
The regular skimmers are chlorined and cousined
  •
Not only recycling but holding hands in a holding pattern the day
             spends outside
Tied up with kitchen twine and stacked neatly by the curb
A cardboard floats by another
             cardboard
The next thing you know the rain has stopped
And starts again before you know it with a drop and a drop and yet
             another drop
A cup of coffee on the counter
The dogs in the backyard in a lather
Just upstream from a VHS player and a bucket of KFC
Stars look down and count the tops
             of our heads
A cell phone tower via a pine tree
The newly emptied mall parking lot via a lake
I got here late
Wildstyle via FatCap along the chain link was red and yellow spray
             roses
The top of my daughter’s head ditto the top
             of my son’s
  •
The afternoon leans toward television and birds
A dream can stay on all morning and does so sticking around for
             drop-off and pickup
Just in time for a quick once-over
The pansies took ditto the ground cover
More an annual than anything else
The top of my daughter’s head is astro fluff in the
             atmosphere
Blue jays on shuffle in the regular trees
For instance bees make their home in the sandbox
Margarine via butter
The sound of the interstate via the sound of the sea
The top of my son’s head is corn silk shot through a cassette deck
             playing early Black Flag
Alone in the kitchen
Mom presses rewind on the microwave
Dogs melt into the linoleum
  •
Not only that but you don’t have to feel bad anymore
Blue jay by blue jay
The birds are real and wait just outside where
             we left them
Just upstream from the new mixed-use building concern and a two-
             liter of  Diet Squirt
Wings in the wallpaper
Wings and glue
I wasn’t going to do it again but maybe you could describe
             the light?
It’s not easy but it’s a little
             easier
Probly those earwigs weren’t even earwigs probly they were rollypollys
Our loved ones are everywhere
Leaves buffeted by the HVAC system
Their names whispered through an intercom in the evergreens
The blue jay’s nesting material was modern and shining recyclables
             reflected on the surface of  the lawn
A twist of  tinfoil in the shape of a swan
  •
A cloud of dryer lint soundproofs the scrape
Open wires braided in a regular fishtail braid or a 6-pack yoke in a
             classic milkmaid
Cotton wool jute and burlap
Feathers from other birds mixed with regular paper
             and fiberglass
Just upstream from a bottle of  Sumatriptan and a case of  bottled
             water
More a grocery list than anything else
A single zigzag
Tinsel blings the classic cup
Leaves repurposed as sanitizer and a kind of traditional blockwood
             painted or flock wallpaper
Banana leaves and artichokes on fast-forward
Cellulose is waterproof
Human hair or horsehair in a perfect carousel
Not only plastic strips but cellophane draped over the vegetation
A cell phone calls from a cornrow
  •
A bird calls from a saucer or plate
A wire hanger hangs in this regular afternoon a kind of dressing
             chair without a seating assignment
Dead twigs dead leaves and dry
             grass
Reclaimed corners
Reclaimed grass
That monoprint of a maple leaf on the platform
A phosphorous updo
For instance neighbor kids find a nest and check on it each morning
             balanced on a pile of chairs
The ground looks up and then returns to whatever it was doing
             before
Curbside check-in for squeakers
Curbside check-in for suet
Broom bristles mop string and
             dental floss
An onion bag in a topknot
That twist of  tinfoil in the shape of a Park-n-Ride
  •
For instance a light applause breaks out over the swing set slide and
             seesaw combo
Did I tell you I aced the bathroom?
A roll of toilet paper
Scotch-Brite and a butter knife
Probly that nest wasn’t even a nest probly it was a regular
             four-in-hand
Warm water white vinegar and Arm & Hammer
An upload of sunlight
For instance butterflies have tongues and hang them out in the day
             to pick up what exactly?
The local station we used to get we don’t get anymore
Voice mail via an otter
A block-graph via a bluebell
Their tongues curl in the light of a flatscreen projecting a host plant and
             a finale
Four long two short
Sip-sipping a hotspot
  •
For instance the grass looks up and then goes back to whatever
             it was doing before
A very heavy rain followed by a very light rain
Did I tell you I replaced everything and
             all at once?
Dog shit in the backyard
The day in a V shape planted in parks parkways and yards or
             seasonally planted around the house
An attachment via an acorn
A chat room via a catkin
If  the day is fernlike and pointed at the ends and irregular or keeled
             as the times and styles change
A four-ring box clutch via a pillbox
A glass organza via a clinkerbell
Those blue jays probly weren’t even blue jays probly they were
             finches
You can’t put the day back together again
A decal of a hawk silhouette
Just upstream from a pair of  headphones and a Stouffer’s
  •
If  the day is tapered twigs leaf stems and a white undersurface
             tolerating the usual errands
A small tree in the shade of a tall tree
An ozone inside a loophole
More a Lean Cuisine than anything else
We let the grass go yellow on purpose and drove straight to the store
My daughter pulls the grass up
             with her fingers
My son uses scissors
If  the day is deciduous and thin with waves at the margins and
             common or common enough
Did I tell you I vacuumed the carpets and dusted
             the picture window?
A picture of what?
An airplane headed in the direction of  the Willamette
Meanwhile the river looks up and then goes back to whatever it was
             doing before
A landing strip via some riprap
Our futures in a bindle
  •
If the day is untidy looking and aromatic with end-leaflets narrowing
             where the sun is lopsided and lobed
I’ll wait outside
We can’t leave the kids in the car anymore
Or wind or cows or people
Schist in your shoes pick up where we left off
A photo-offset of a fern into a
             spreadsheet
The blue flame in the new gas stove has fins
If  the day is irregular on both sides and pebbled or modified by
             acrylics and permanent
Black toner cartridge via a starling
A stop bath via a sparrow
The afternoon clears the table for flowers and more
             television
Not only whatever’s on but a pinnate in the past
More a dinette set than anything else
The day ticking over in the fixer bath
  •
Meanwhile a northern flicker bends a piece of plexiglass into a wind
             chime
Did I tell you I raked the leaves and put them all into a black
             Glad bag?
Meanwhile a black-capped chickadee
One kid asleep upstairs another on the pot
Bird clutter marks the spot
Just upstream from a newly relaxed regulation and the brand new
             Jiffy Lube
A birdbath in a dribble!
A damselfly vacates the day in a blur
A mosquito on a daisy
My daughter looks up and then goes back to whatever it was she was
             doing before
The afternoon divided up into zones
Where her new sounds meanwhile astound the daylight
             on a leaf
An off-brand beetle duct-tapes the water
X’s & O’s
  •
You don’t have to if  you don’t want to
Pink rollers via a ripple
Little white sticks via a balk
Meanwhile a deer tick slides into the very last reserved parking spot
Under arms around the ears back of the knees and
             between the legs
Meanwhile inside a belly button
A pink parking pass flutters between the seat cushions
A speckle-winged quill vacates the day in a blind
More a leftover than anything else
That grass probly wasn’t even grass probly it was a roll of   Diamond Pro
             Fescue or Jade 50
A blue tint ditto a cloud of flies
Meanwhile a regular water strider enamels the edge of a pond
             making room for you and the rest of  the day
A stork inside your mind
Dots and lines

In other places we felt much the same as we do today only
             more so
Meanwhile a mayfly floats by another mayfly
A hard drive via a hedge
A Bluetooth via a squiggle
Oh look someone remembered to take out the compost
Meanwhile mites in a double clasp and peaked felt number wish you
             well and more
White foam flowers on a polished floor
Who will tape their wings back?
Who will fold their corners?
A common green lacewing has an appointment someplace else
             altogether and will keep it
To a thrip or a honeydew?
A grand tour
Just upstream from a stackable washer/dryer unit and the brand new
             FreshDirect
The loop that keeps happening in the leaf litter
  •
Before you know it that light has changed from checker mallow and
             milkweed to something more en-suite
Whites and sulphurs
Probly that lacewing wasn’t even a lacewing probly it was a green
             smudge
Hey! Hey kids!
Meanwhile a green comma or a common
             ringlet
Their wings are made of cardboard and Reynolds Wrap
A rubber band here a rubber band there
Meanwhile real sunlight sneaks up the wall somewhere between
             butterfly yellow and butterfly brown
Not a dream really just an ordinary afternoon
What color is that goldenrod?
A focal point via a knob
The new streaming service was all aflutter and temporarily
             unavailable
Not only that but a golden hairstreak
One kid on the couch the other in a bole
  •
Just between the dimmer switch and a short circuit of  local or overlit
             fritillaries
Hi-Liter yellow and chisel tipped
A bucket of  honeysuckle
Bring the car around I’ll be right out!
Did I tell you I aced the console with some Orange Glo ditto the late
             afternoon?
They blanket the lawn in summer
A long dash followed by a short dash
Right between a commotion of  track lighting and a dribble of newish
             antibiotics
A newish drop in the bucket
An overflow of stillness and snacks
My son looks up and then goes back to whatever it was he was
             doing before
The day is nonslip and early
A download of nervy and rainbowed fluorescence
A bedhead floats by another bedhead
  •
Just between the newly installed porch floods and a small handful of
             cabbage whites
A vertical frequency to it
A sprinkle of what exactly?
Not only that but our intentions stacked up
             in a swirl
The bunting’s vocals were lip-synced and weird ditto the dishwasher’s
A voice box via a gorge
A yellow Lego on top of a yellow Lego
Right between a semi-transparent aftereffect and a latticed or
             crosshatched bit of fluff
An upgrade via a wrinkle

Wide open spaces
Or a glint in the kitchen counter where a local slope wrinkles a bowl

The toaster shimmies

A plug-in via a stob
Rods and cones
Or cuckoo bees spun out in a bright wash of parallel and early or late

Just upstream from a buffet-style weekend special and some notable

Pollen paints the car and cleans out eczema
Wicks out the margins
Wisteria points up the positives of nonverbal

Burnt toast and bitumen

Taller ones
Pedal bikes pushed up and down the walk all day transfigure
             the pavements in a wired curlicue
A fiddlehead with arms and legs

One television is off the other is vertical rays of  light

Or a #2 pencil beam crinkles the cornea in the backyard feathering seed
             starters and stems
The day feels irreversible and will stay inside a Dixie cup
Things stick to the door screen
Windy light broken off and moth dust broken off
Ribs and holes
Not only that but a complicated system of noticing and a dob of
             apple juice
You blow on it and it glows
Or a refurbished working day backlights the hanging geraniums a
             handful of pink fiberglass
A lake effect glancing off the sideboard
A streamer via a stickle
A cooler via a brook
More than that those green and gold flecked inlays look away
A creek bed in the hallway   
A spiral floats by another spiral
  •
And pink and blue transparencies gel the day each morning
And pansies more than you
You don’t have to wonder about the sky anymore you don’t have to
             ask what to wear
Just upstream from a sketchy weather system and the new overpass
High on glue
The raindrops can’t lash the ferns they can’t
             flash flood a pinna
Then the sun comes out again
And trees are stressed out and can’t get going either
It’s dinnertime breakfast is over
Over and over my son’s voice across the lawn a white sparkler then
             a green sparkler then a white
Someone comes running
Probly those geraniums aren’t even geraniums probly they’re trailing
             accents
Local traffic
Left to your own devices you would watch TV clips all day and              
             make more toast and then what brush your teeth?
  •
And vacuuming the carpet makes a nice smell part burnt tips part
             wet dog
It’s difficult to think of something to do
A snip floats by another snip
I guess what you’re doing today is doing chores
I picked up everything in the house and put them all back down just
             to the left of themselves
Pajamas and urine
A throw rug via a jelly roll
And its color time and petal time again & leaves lift the light outside
             the window just enough
Let the flowers back in ditto the dog
You only have a few minutes for anything it’s hardly enough time
      to get started
Hey! Hey trees!

We were up late and everyone had been drinking, and someone said, Hey, is that God’s
head on the boil?
We didn’t know where to look or what to think, it was obviously some sort of perverse
joke, or not, right?
And the conversation went on for days, sober, drunk, asleep, awake, what did it matter?
Some of us felt the real time was for something, but what?
And the questions kept coming, once they started, my favorite one being two strung
together, What makes art “modern” and what does “urgent” mean now?
Where was the greater good? That was another one bandied about,
followed by Where was the common tent? which gave a feeling of empathy for a minute
and then grief because, well, where was it?
Will you arm, hoard seeds, go hungry? Those terrified me because, after all, who will
repair things when the end is pale or dark?
Where will you hide out
when capital runs out, when water? Which will be greater, the heat or the cold?
Wait, did God’s boiling head just say something? Cry out Go to hell from a giant lobster
pot? Tantalizing us with where to go next?
Are phosphorescent lamps to mark escape paths?
Not that it’s not a great party, but whose place is this? Igniting

I was one year old when my nanny went away
leaving no memory of a face that watched,
arms that held, hands that fed and cleaned me,
left no record of her voice or name. My father
died, leaving wisps of pipe smoke for a memory.
My mother went away to write in London,
left me at her home place, Ballyrankin,
a sheltered farm in the Slaney river valley.
I listened to stories from a paralyzed aunt
sitting among sleepy dogs next to the fire.
Statia cooked every day for the dining room,
churned butter, gave sugared bread to me and
her child Bernie, fed outside men in dirty boots
and greasy caps in her stone-flagged kitchen that
smelt of damp clothes, roasting meat, and cake.
I fished for minnows in Shillelagh stream under ash trees
where filtered sunlight made pools of silver water.
On one side horses grazed and swished
their tails at flies, on the far side cows rubbed
their backs against low beech tree branches.
My mother went away to hospital, left me with

They warned against crying. I cried louder.

There were no road rails.
I remember no road rails and the death depth off the cliffs
we motored along.
I remember speed in a parched Chevy clunker that could not have sped,
and bench seats, and no buckles, and bare thighs peeling off faux leather
at every hairpin. Every elevated canyon mile was a feat
but a breath of less slickened air too, less cog and fume — 
a winding away from
the wavering, sea-leg steam off blinding sidewalks,
infinite sidewalks and other shoeless kids
kicking rusted palm leaves outside infinite apartment complexes. Away from
our corner
of the valley of concrete corners, of
no evidence of valley besides boulders stacked in the distance of every vista.
The driver was a stranger, was my mother after my whole life had passed
with stranger after stranger,
was my mother after seven years, and me at seven years
with her driving that snuff-colored Nova from her blinding valley not a valley — 
through Laurel, Topanga, Malibu
canyons all the way to some fantastic, to her beloved
blue — eucalyptus
choking local growth the whole trek. And the cooling air as we  efforted west,
and the jolt of a castle, The Castle,
in a distant crook of a range that hid the slate of the ocean,
made me want to stop moving
but not stop here. I remember hoping
to find hermit crabs the size of the mole on my right side chin.
And if I tethered them to a stick they’d line up by mass and trade shells, find homes
that fit. And there’d be one left without, one torn out. A book said
a scientist leaned into wet sand, watched a torn crab die
in the beak of a gull. I can’t remember if I saw that death or read it.  I remember
watching a wrong castle tucked into a wrong mountain notch on the chin of the sky,
like the hermit mole on my chin
if my face were the sky. “It’s a beauty mark,”
my mother had said, “Don’t pick at it.” I eyed that smoking stranger at the wheel
and dug my nail in
as the Pacific swelled into view that first time.

Dear A. — Nailing crockery to the walls
was not something I ever understood,
but Simonetta’s maiolica falls,
like this sideboard, painted wood,
under the enchantment of a freehand look — 
a curling script, a loose grape tendril,
the forms that hecatomb smoke took
purling to a Roman god’s nostril    ...    
Because geranium is crinkled
in the spillage from the wishing well,
now outdated and backfilled,
this whole place evinces the nature
of a souvenir plate. Another tell:
the mosquito flourish in its signature.ii
The rustic bicycle, like a pen
that spent its ink, wrote an invisible sentence
to the ramparts and back, now and again
rolling through the arches of an aqueduct
dowsing with its sixth sense
across the hillsides. Locals tucked
plastic water bottles under spouts
chiseled into lions’ pouts
stationed at intervals, like shrines.
Their cars idled while they stooped,
and on Sundays even formed lines.
They trust this water more, Lorenzo whooped,
than what comes out of their taps?
The sources snake beneath the maps.iii
The little terrier Amore, they warned me,
had eaten the seat belts; so there I was,
my friend, fearing whiplash in the back seat
(no headrest either!), in all respects afloat — 
Simonetta on alert for signs of gallantry,
like the wives of those diminished Casanovas
who dream they’ve merely grown discreet.
And the dissertation she once wrote
on courtesan-poetesses, fancying herself
of that ilk (“Like me!” — a phrase she’d strew

his tongue as a tip
slid under a mug

would collect it too

were further gone — one in Wisconsin,

nothing would bloom on it.

No one knows where I’m going,

I heard outside last night might
lead me to the terrain and call out
the custodians so they can
surround and welcome me, or
do whatever they want to do. I won’t
speak, won’t say my name even if
they try to coerce me, or play
unearthly music, such as sailors
hear far out on the Atlantic, in fog
so thick they venture to climb it
to reach clear sky. Some do and speak
of large blue birds that glide there
silently as ghosts, but those men
return too damaged to speak much
or stay above ground very long.
The owl could tell more, if he wanted,
but he won’t. And not only that,
he’s decided he will never be seen.2
I’m happy to honor that, but I’d like

Is he tall and white, from the Arctic,
or a pygmy, from further south?
Is he long-eared or spectacled? I want
to hear again the noise he made,
was it a screech, or a staccato huhuhu
followed by a deep-drawn whoo,
or did it sound like wood being sawn?
I am ashamed I paid it no attention.
I did not know then he was a messenger,
albeit a taciturn one. How does he know
me, and why is he so interested? Once
a parrot took stock of me, learnt to speak
my name in exactly the tones I said it in,
mimicked it endlessly and so loudly
that I ran from my laughing friend’s house
with my shrill-voiced name hurling after me.3
Where does the owl go during the day?
How can he know I’ll still be here
when he surfaces? I do take trains — 
I go north sometimes, pulled by my past.
I fly to places. Will he know all this
and follow me everywhere? When can I
expect his sounds to morph into spoken
words that I understand and act on,
if I agree with him? But if I decide
to stay put, never leave the bedroom,
will he get fed up standing there
and row away through the night air,
hooting a farewell? I don’t think so,
no, this fellow is here for the duration
of my stay on this enormous ball
and could tell right now how long that
will be, and what messy adventures
are still ahead of me, but his trick is
to keep as schtum on such stuff as
the wooden owl on my bedside table.4
I’ve heard stories about owls, how they
appear from nowhere at the edge of things
to sit watching, usually staying silent,
but sometimes uttering a few words in
their night language we don’t understand.
That’s my fellow, although I don’t know him.
Should I leave the house and hold my
right arm out for him to land on and turn
his big eyes on me? As if he’d be so compliant.
Or should I try to forget him, pretend
he’s not there in the dark, like a tree
I hadn’t noticed growing? Oh, at least
I should stop mentioning him here, but what
else can I write about? Not the journey
I’m taking that I know nothing of, not yet,
and when I do I mightn’t feel like writing.
I think the solution might be to buy
a T-shirt with an owl printed on it,
a blue owl, on a yellow shirt, and write
about that small fellow to begin with.5
What I want to learn is this: do owls
ever venture inside, to stand on a corner-
table, cock their heads to one side,
and take in completely what’s going on?
There are mice here that may be welcome,
but I know my owl would be suspicious.
He’d assume I want him inside to see
what he looks like, to make friends with him,
so he’ll be kind to me. I could promise
to wear a blindfold and say nothing,
act like I don’t know he’s there, but I will
know and that’s enough. I think I hear
his thoughts and I’m sure he hears mine.
I feel his big eyes on me all the time.
Maybe I should start carrying the wooden
owl around with me, and practice owl noises.
When is he going to tell me what he has to?
I’m not asking for a map, but I’d like to know
where I’m headed, if not where I’ll end up.
And I’d like to know it as soon as I can.6
When I say I hear his thoughts, I hear some,
not the important ones. And here’s one
of mine — if he ventured inside this house
he’d see something that might intrigue him,
a hand-knitted toilet roll cover, in rings of
purple, red, and white. Like an unknown planet
hanging in the sky. I’d let him have it, take it
back to his nest, or his hollow tree trunk, or his
half-sunken boat. I know he’ll assume this
is another example of special pleading,
and I accept that. Would I do better to ignore
him, let him stay out there, like a pinecone
that remains unobserved? I saw my doctor
yesterday, he spoke of the deterioration,
and I felt the owl was hiding in a cupboard,
agreeing with every word. After that I went
to my sister’s grave and the owl flew back
to wherever he’s been ordered to lurk
while observing me. Maybe I should feel
privileged to have his full-time attention.7
This morning I captured a beetle climbing
the parsley. I put him in an empty matchbox,
wondering what the owl thought of this.
Would it impact what might be unfolding?
I doubted this. I slipped on some spidery jazz
that I knew would annoy the owl. He needed
to be in control. I ground coffee beans
and made espresso. The aroma wafted through
the house. I freed the beetle to explore
the table, and when it wandered off the edge
I let it. I’m sure it survived, but I’m not bothered,
just as I know the owl doesn’t care about me.
We are thrown together, all of us, by winds
that come here from far-off worlds. I sipped
my coffee, humming the tune spun through
the jazz, and I felt quite well for the first time
in weeks, even months. Was the owl watching — 
had he been in contact with the beetle?
And what was their collective verdict on me?
Did it add up to more negative evidence?8
OK, I’m blanking him. I watched a crow today,
really admired how he operated, looking
after the young ones, his partner, none of
this spying on others. I’ve decided I don’t like
owls, their self-absorption, or their nosiness
about people. I know which I’d rather be.
And I don’t have to deal with a crow stalking me.
The owl would laugh about these thoughts.
He’s been given the task of waiting to release,
when he can, exactly what I need to know
or what he can reveal. I admit he’s not easy
but, shit, he’s the dumb card I’ve been dealt
and I have to pretend I like him. Can I ask him
about the Oxford and Cambridge rowers,
or about the hairdressers the Louisianians use,
or the tiger cubs that Texans keep as pets?
The owl would make minced meat of them all.
I wish he would hoot another noise to me.
I might even acknowledge his importance,
given my situation, but I won’t reveal anything.9
I felt the presence of the owl last night.
He was in the room with me. Not literally — 
he appeared in a dream, where a blue van
struggled up an icy road before sliding back
in a horrible, wriggling way, to what felt
like an end. I’m not sure how it seemed so.
And I can’t say where the owl was in this
little film, except he was definitely there.
This morning I came down the stairs,
expecting some sign from him. I found
a few brown feathers on a white plate
on the kitchen table. OK, then, he must be
a brown owl, but why donate some feathers,
and what did these denote? I made coffee,
then put on a CD of Anouar Brahem’s oud
that seemed to suit the moment. And I
decided it was the time to poach two eggs
to serve on top of two slices of rye bread
while I primed the espresso machine again
and asked myself what the owl was saying.10
Those feathers were gone from the plate
when I went back for them this evening,
so I wondered if maybe I’d imagined them,
or if they’d fluttered up from the eggs
before I’d poached them. That doubt was
caused by the owl, I was sure — I’d made him
careless, and he was recovering his poise,
his control. And I was back in the place
where I knew nothing, where he liked me to be.
I opened the door and stood there, listening,
but no owl sound came. Then a bat just barely
avoided my head, and glided toward the moon.
I stood watching this leathery fellow, then
closed the door, and opened some wine.
How much did the owl control? Would I
be attacked by a rat tonight while I slept,
not savagely, but enough to terrify me?
Or would cockroaches swarm on my duvet,
clicking enough to wake me? The idea being
that these would render me so punch-drunk
I’d welcome whatever the owl had to say.11
I spent the morning drawing owl after owl
on bits of paper, and after I’d got somewhere
near a proper depiction, I found a black marker
and reproduced it on an A2 drawing page
which I Pritt Sticked onto the gable wall, then
I dug out my old black bow and four arrows
and unleashed these into the body of the owl.
I knew I was being provocative, maybe even
launching an act of war, but I could take no
more, and couldn’t see what I had to lose.
The owl clearly was unmoved by this, so I
repeated the desecration four times over
till the drawn owl looked machine-gunned,
whereupon I flung the bow down on the grass
and went in to pour a large glass of  Talisker
for the first time in months, if not years.
It still tasted good. I slipped on Kind of Blue,
which always chilled me, and lay on the sofa
with my shoes kicked off, and the curtains
wide open. I thought, let the owl do his worst.12
When the dark came, I lurked in the kitchen,
bow in hand, arrows in the quiver that hung
from my left shoulder, like the Robin Hood
I wanted to play in the school pantomime — 
I got Little John instead! I kept looking out at
the dark garden, wondering if I should be there,
waiting to fire arrows at any sound or movement.
Why did I want to kill the owl? He hadn’t given
me the news I dreaded, but he’d stayed silent.
That was more than I could bear. I poured a
glass of Malbec and put on a CD of Baltic jazz.
Did he think I could wait forever, as if I were
a rock? I sliced some cheddar and a heel of bread,
opened the back door and went out. The moon
turned its big eye onto me, and I saw it wobble.
The stars hummed along. Where am I going?
I shouted at all of them. There was no response.
Then far off, I heard a faint huhuhu followed by
a whoo. You cowardly bastard! I roared, and
sprayed the arrows all over the blackened world.

I figure I guess it shouldn’t be a surprise that she visited
seeing how dark I was, un ichan of  negro, of  zájtik.
And zájtik isn’t bad. Sometimes it brings rainbows, arco irises, kusamalut
Atelti told me something she heard in El Salvador, algo de mis abuelos y abuelas, both alive and dead

              leaving ashes to wind for the volcano, church
              Sky, how do you ask — in between sand, river, road
So what does it mean? Where’s the answer at the end? The moral?
The hail rattling outside: clattaraka araka araka araka araka — cla ttaraka taraka taraka taraka taraka
taraka ka ka ka kuh kuh
and me without my raincoat.
“Don’t be outside by the time I leave,” I said.
“Y qué,” she said as more hail hit the windows, a few pellets falling onto the carpet inside.
And it continued.
And she added some rain a bit after.
When it was time to leave
I stepped outside
it still rained
and was offered an umbrella to the car
which I refused.
Mi hermana, Atelti, was there to stay. So I thought, “Get   wet.
If  you’re so desperate
Talk

   I've become the person who says Darling, who says Sugarpie,     Honeybunch, Snugglebear—and that’s just for my children.     What I call my husband is unprintable. You’re welcome. I am     his sweetheart, and finally, finally—I answer to his call and his     alone. Animals are named for people, places, or perhaps a little     Latin. Plants invite names for colors or plant-parts. When you     get a group of heartbeats together you get names that call out     into the evening’s first radiance of planets: a quiver of cobras,     a maelstrom of salamanders, an audience of squid, or an ostentation     of peacocks. But what is it called when creatures on this earth curl     and sleep, when shadows of moons we don’t yet know brush across     our faces? And what is the name for the movement we make when     we wake, swiping hand or claw or wing across our face, like trying     to remember a path or a river we’ve only visited in our dreams.

Like nights we knelt on the dirt floor
of a dugout, leaned our heads back,
eyes twitching gone, and popped nitrous
canisters into the communion shapes
of our mouths, slipped inside where
everything seemed to be falling snow,
ice, the time split between chasing flies
through a darkened park and sprawling
in sycamore bark—how clean that abyss
we drifted in, like dew, more like pollen,
on our skins; and, beneath, a want
for touch, a kiss, a return. Like nothing
back then, to break an arm latching on
to the bumper of an Impala, or settling back 
as the car took us as far as the salted bridge,
before letting the ride go with a mitten
caught behind the chrome waving
from the other side of the river. Like this, 
you said, sliding a needle, watching
dope plunge, the body's rush and tow
until you felt something like an angel
hovering above, but it was only pigeon
feathers deviling the air. Those friends
are gone: some dead, dying, locked up
or jailed in themselves; and when I see
some kids running in the heat of a taillight
swirling behind them, I remember we
wanted only to quiet our bodies, their 
unnatural hum, a vague pull inward,
some thin furrows gliding over the snow.

All of us were boys only some were taller or already in high school, and almost

into a 180, kicking 
a leg out and landing it, the only way to run
through the neighborhood
was to run through it
together, flipping off cops and skinheads, I almost

   It sits with a fork made from a lotus on an ivory chair eating an elephant steak in the company of bears and feral nautch girls on a monsoon evening incandescent with an appetite as mighty as railroads spann’d across seas and reclines, its cheeks burnished, its ass varnished by suns setting on bronze and sugared with saltpetre, its torso a tableaux for the annals of rectitude, the theatre for roiling or robust passage, a veritable Suez Canal towards missionary victories which thrust from such bejeweled and oiled loins anointed by coin— that emission of plump plums, lump sums into the Ganges, that coiling coy virgin maiden winding her languid locks, batting her lashes to its lashes— its spine a gentle wire. Supine, its belly swells with salt and figs with meat and treaties, it corks open a profound song— itself it sings into books heavy with truths on the chair dressed with leather and raw hides kissed by ox blood smeared with beef dung lined with raw silk woven from worms plucked from boughs basted across its pious beaming eyes its spidery ghosted lids, and its byzantine glance unmoors from its Chinese porcelain and crosses the ebony table polished with lac secreted from the cloaca of the kerria lacca set with glazed cakes eaten by pinked mouths wearing crimson robes, to its guests polished and glossed and stained by the ooze drawn to color the uncolored raw linen, the wood, the human. Then its wrist cuffed by gold and cowries and studded with coral draws a whisper- thin muslin veil dyed carmine— sucked from crushed scale of cochineal boiled in ammonia and bled into curds and rouge glinting sanguineous and turbid between bug and rug snug a thug in redcoat or a turncoat carrying urns of this stuff— from estates of cocoa coconut calico— across its face while soft éclairs of chocolate bumble out from its plumed rump choked with gum and linseed flax and cassia cinnamon and pepper like so many lines of blood underwriting the mutton and not the goat so it can sell them with a name of a place like scarves or garlanded whores moored to wharves suckled by mother of pearl or teas named after Earls and they with whole scores to settle settle for homemade cures nettles ginger turmeric— a paste or to taste—and it steals and seals in letters scented with sandal sent abroad waxed and pressed with cornelian gems honed from ground it owns and makes stone from their flesh ekes ink from their sweat soaks indigo in lye fermented with time and makes color so it can bid for its own passage, the passage, O of this soul, to India!

There once lived a great king whose twin wives could bear him no children. A wandering sage saw the king’s grief and offered him a magical mango. She who ate the mango would be with child. As he had two wives, the king cut the mango into two perfect halves and offered one half to each wife. After nine months, each wife gave birth to one lifeless half. Horrified, the king ordered these clots of flesh to be left in the forest. A wandering demon found the two lifeless halves and cupped one in each palm. When she brought them together, the two halves fused and a whole child was made in front of her eyes—the demon named the child Jarasandha.
Years passed by and this child grew to be an intimidating and invincible warrior. In a fight with Bhim, an equally invincible warrior, Jarasandha was ripped in half by his enemy. But, each time he was ripped apart, his halves found a way to meet up and become whole. Krishna, who witnessed how Jarasandha’s flesh found its own way back to flesh, motioned to his own cousin with his fingers: toss the halves of his body in opposite directions, he
suggested.
So, when Bhim ripped Jarasandha apart once again, he swung his left half to the right side of the arena and his right half to the left. And his body found no way to return to itself.

  In the epilogue to The Autobiography of Malcolm X, Alex Haley recounts meeting a pensive Malcolm at the Kennedy airport, watching newly immigrated children “romping and playing” in their sudden home. “By tomorrow night,” Malcolm says to Alex, “they’ll know how to say their first English word—nigger.”
Before cable television arrived in India, America was a white nation. I imagined New England snows dusting California and Miami’s beaches stretched across Appalachia. America was a papier-mâché parody patched together by a cheaply hired prop maker. Geographic accuracy was sacrificed to the interpersonal dramas of Betty and Veronica, and the American banquet was limited to the malted and fried offerings in Pop’s Chock’lit Shoppe, where the Riverdale gang solved the real geopolitical problems of how to get Reggie off Moose’s back with the help of Archie’s fumbling charms. Here, class warfare came with a side of fries. There were rumors of distant family members “settling” in “North Dakota” or “Oklahoma”—names that put themselves together like Lego castles: hard-edged and jutting out with an abrupt L or a particularly pokey K.
Blackness was just a rumor too. Blackness flickered in the background of photographs they sent back from these mysterious locations: here’s an uncle waving at us from a glittering Times Square (Los Angeles); here’s an aunt waving at us mid-way through the soft-focus neon breakfasts with Aunt Jemima’s maple syrup (made from maple leaves); here’s a nephew waving at us next to the poster of a red and white Michael Jordan in a quilted bedroom, his rotund brown body snuggled in tie-dye and tucked into tartan flannel sheets. Blackness was a rumor, that is, until Michael Jackson’s Bad ripped into our consciousness and suddenly, knobby-kneed pre-teens found a way to make stringy curls with coconut oil stolen from their mothers’ kitchens and started moonwalking backwards into my Social Studies classrooms, all snappy crotch and jaunty limbs. We girls rolled our eyes but we kept on watching.
It wasn’t long before Jackson’s unsparing gaze, draped in slick black leather, began replacing the glowing pastel Ganeshes and Saraswatis hanging above study desks. But replacing an elephantine god’s soft paunch with lean, mean celebrity did not save us from our own ignorance of how blackness and brownness were connected through a struggle for economic self-realization and human rights. While kids in Chennai were rehearsing Michael Peters’ signature choreography for “Thriller” and pretending to be zombies—little exemplary half-dead spectacles—Union Carbide was industriously shirking responsibility for the Bhopal Tragedy, which choked thousands of Indians to death, and black mortality was spiking in violent, homicidal protest of the US DEA’s drug buys and cocaine busts.
In other words, Tamilians blinked away Michael Jackson’s blackness. We kept the heat and thunder of his fat synth bass, which found its way into Ilayaraaja’s electric disco in films of the late 1980s like Vetri Vizha and Agni Natchathiram. We kept the ebullient automation of his moves, which became a muscular theme in Prabhu Deva’s blend of baggy breakdance and whimsical terukoothu folk dancing in the 1990s. But we forgot his blackness. In time, the lightning of his presence was replaced by the grey hum of CNN, Cops, Law & Order, and the dull horror of handcuffs on dark wrists. Posters yellowed, cassettes spooled out, and my moonwalking classmates found their scientific calculators and study guides again.
But the rumors of racial difference in George Bush Sr.’s America continued to bloom and wilt in morose cycles in my childhood homes into the 1990s. In damp clusters, it grew like moss under rocks. Rootless, it stretched its stringy arms and held us by the ankles; it grew like mold between bathroom tiles; it spun itself fine and strong, webbing into corners where our brooms couldn’t reach. In time, the mossy rocks lined our after-dinner walks past the hibiscus bushes. In time, a grandmother slipped on the bathroom tiles and stayed in bed, fed conjee by a fatherless girl brought in from the village and the moss grew between her toes and drew her into the earth where they buried the nameless pets and tossed the chicken feathers. In time, the spiders hung so low they fell into pickle jars every time a child fished for a gooseberry or a slice of stony green mango from the brine. And from this brine, in time, we learned to believe that it existed. And as Tamilian families began drifting from the flashy monsoons of India to the June gloom of the California bay or to the sharp wet summers of the Keys, they carried the damp and stench in suitcases and buried it in hushed conversations. They made a poultice of moss and spider web and lodged it in the prayer books, hung it around the children’s necks like a talisman, and they said—as long as she doesn’t marry a black man.

Because a lie is not a lie if the teller
believes it, the way beautiful things
 
reassure us of the world’s wholeness,
of our wholeness, is not quite a lie.
 
Beautiful things believe their own
narrative, the narrative that makes them
 
beautiful. I almost believed it
until the new mother strapped
 
her infant to her chest, opened
the eighth-floor window,
 
and jumped. My daughter tells me,
after her preschool field trip
 
to the Firefighter Museum,
about the elephant mask, its hose
 
like a trunk, and the video of a man
on fire being smothered in blankets.
 
She asks me if she knows anyone
who got dead in a fire, anyone who
 got fired. When will I die? she asks.
When I was a child, I churched
 
my hands, I steepled my hands,
and all the people were inside,
 
each finger a man, a woman,
a child. When I die, will you
 still love me? she asks. The mother
cracked on the pavement—
 
how did the baby live? Look,
he smiles and totters around
 
the apartment eight stories up.
Beautiful things reassure us
 
of the world’s wholeness:
each child sliding down the pole
 
into the fire captain’s arms.
But what’s whole doesn’t sell
 
itself as such: buy this whole apple,
this whole car. Live this whole life.
 
A lie is not a lie if the teller
believes it? Next time the man
 
in the video will not ignite.
The baby will open like a parachute.

I carried my fear of the world
to my children, but they refused it.
 
I carried my fear of the world
on my chest, where I once carried
my children, where some nights it slept
as newborns sleep, where it purred

sweat from my clavicles.

I carried it, and it repaid me

Whose feet would I be left at?
 
I carried my fear of the world

at its beauty but keeping my hands still—
keeping my eyes on its mouth, its teeth.

I stroked it or I did not dare to stroke it.

I carried my terrible awe.
 
I carried my fear of the world

She was my Sunday school teacher
when I was just seven and eight.
He was the newly hired pastor,
 
an albino, alarming sight
with his transparent eyelashes
and mouse-pink skin that looked like it
 
might hurt whenever she caressed
his arm. Since Eva was her name,
to my child’s mind it made great sense
 
that she should fall in love with him.
He was Adán. Before the Fall
and afterward, her invert twin.
 
And she, Eva, was blonde as well,
though more robust, like Liv Ullmann.
I loved her honey hair, her full
 
lips; her green eyes a nameless sin.
(Not that I worried all that much—
the church was Presbyterian.)
 
In Sunday school, her way to teach
us kids to pray was to comment
on all the beauty we could touch
 
or see in our environment.
My hand was always in the air
to volunteer my sentiment.
 
Since other kids considered prayer
a chore, the floor was usually mine.
My list of joys left out her hair
 
but blessed the red hibiscus seen
through the windows while others bowed
their heads. Her heart I schemed to win
 
with purple prose on meringue clouds.
—For who was Adán, anyway,
I thought, but nada spelled backward?
 
While hers, reversed, called out, Ave! Ave! The lyric of a bird
born and airborne on the same day.
 
But it was night when I saw her
outside the church for the last time:
yellow light, mosquitoes, summer.
 
I shaped a barking dog, a fine
but disembodied pair of wings
with my hands. She spoke in hushed tones
 
to my parents. The next day I would find
myself up north, in a strange house,
without my tongue and almost blind,
 
there was so much to see. This caused
Cuba, my past, to be eclipsed
in time, but Eva stayed, a loss.
 Ave, I learned, meant also this:Farewell! I haven’t seen her since.

She taught me the names of flowers: calendula, ranunculus, Iceland
poppy. And the medicinal uses of herbs: Fenugreek opens up a
stuffy head; goldenseal lubricates the cracked mucous membranes.
Over a circa 1820 American dropleaf table, she told me asparagus
was the broom of the kidneys. I hadn't understood at first and
thought she'd used a German word I pictured as brüm and not as the
little stalks standing on their heads, sweeping out the impurities. I
learned to make the perfect roux for soufflé and became her
efficient assistant in the kitchen—dicing and chopping, she once
told me, with unparalleled patience. Then one day she began to
accidentally break my Depression glassware, and I recalled how
she'd giggled when she told me that in two years of marriage she
had single-handedly decimated her husband's glass collection
dating from 1790 to 1810, including a rare wedding goblet. In the
doorway to the back porch she stated simply that my presence
made her feel strangled, it was nothing I was doing or could do. We
saw a therapist for six years, while my collection dwindled then
became memory. With unparalleled patience I jumped through
hoop after burning hoop, the therapist pointed out, but I heard that
as praise for my prowess and continued to balance Bauer plates on
my nose on command; hold growling tigers off with Windsor dining
room chairs; juggle career, job, hope, and nightly tempests with
unparalleled dexterity. I could reassemble anything: shattered pictures
of us crossing the street with canes in the future, my hand under her
elbow. My heart. But what I lacked, I can see now, was the ability
to dissemble. Finally, she brought home a Cuisinart food processor,
and I started hearing the minutes slicing away with ferocious velocity,
time doing its soft-shoe faster and faster like Fred Astaire on
amphetamines. Memories of flowers and herbs were sacrificed to
the angry god of its vortex. Your voice is like acid on my skin, she
said after twelve years, then grabbed her Cuisinart and left me
behind like so much history.

There are no doors between the rooms. The archways bore
through the house like a tunnel through a mountain. The room
one falls into after my parents’ is the largest and serves as two
bedrooms divided by an invisible wall. Half of it is my brother’s
and the other half my sister and I share, but not at first.
 
Earlier, I have a bed to myself on the side of the room nearest the
kitchen. My bed is low and on one side a wooden rail can be
dragged up noisily and clicked into place.
 
          It is here my little goat wakes me, grabbing the covers off
          me with her teeth. We play in the empty pig shelter at the
          far end of the patio while my mother washes clothes in a
          palangana and throws the soapy water across the concrete,
          where it steams.
 
          But my father is a butcher by profession, and my family
          has other plans for my goat: a Sunday picnic at the zoo in
          Havana. The day is huge and blue and breezy. My sister
          teases me for not eating and says my goat is delicious. I
          stray away to watch the monkeys.
 
          I give one of the monkeys near the fence my banana. As it
          finishes peeling it meticulously, another monkey appears
          behind it and shoves the banana into its own mouth. The
          first monkey turns around, slaps it in the face with the
          empty peel, but that monkey isn’t sorry and starts jumping
          and screeching and showing its yellow teeth.
 
          For many years, those monkeys are all I can remember
          about the picnic at the zoo.

Later, when my sister and I share a bed on the other side of the room,
I can see the tall narrow cabinet right inside my parents’ room. My
father always puts his hat on top of it as he walks in. And at night,
through the mosquito netting, it is a tall thin man wearing a straw
hat, lurking just outside the door, watching me in a sinister way. The
dead weight of my sister’s habitual leg thrown across my body is no
talisman. I have to keep waking myself up, sweaty and tense, to
make sure he hasn’t moved any closer.

Regla lesbia: Flexible rule that may be adjusted to any
body to be measured. Compare regla fija: standard. 
                                                    —The Velázquez Dictionary



I.
In the garden, it’s there. Even when you’re inside you feel it,
as though it were you standing naked among the weeds,
 
the tips of the bougainvillea bursting into flame, your nipples
ruffled like the skin of a lake by a breeze.
 
You worship the invisible body like an old-fashioned lover, from afar,
loving the specificity of space between you.
 
Sometimes at night it stretches out on the empty side
of the bed, stares at you with the length of its invisible surface.
 
Every contour of your body not filled by you is molded
by the attentiveness of the invisible body, whose breath surrounds
     you.
 
It’s more than prayer it wants—more than language, with its
     conditions.
The invisible body demands you invent new senses to receive it,
 
new places on your body to marvel at its subtlety,
like the eyes of the deaf percussionist that perceive sound.
 
II.
The invisible body wants you to become a satellite dish,
tuned to what exists only because your body calls to it.
 
Like the woman who had her kitchen remodeled to make room
for the microwave she’d entered a contest for. Then won.
 
III.
When asked whether falling in love was about acquisitiveness,
about the ego, the seventy-five-year-old poet
 
responded that the ego had nothing to do with it;
it was the need for union with the beloved.
 
Rumi asks, Who is it we spend our entire lives loving? 
 
IV.
How, then, do you measure the invisible body,
which resists commitment but is faithful?
 
Is it clear who the beloved is, when no clear
body exists that can be measured against a standard?
 
V.
The invisible body sometimes acquires a body—it’s so convincing,
it takes you a while to figure out it’s really the invisible body.
 
Like someone who has been reading your journal,
it has decoded from your petty, daily complaints the open sesame
 
that slides the stone from the hidden cave’s opening
and cleans you out while you sleep, leaving a sarcastic note.
 
It wants you to know it was doing you a favor, besides,
how else did you think you’d discover the cave’s precise location?
 
When Aphrodite sharpens you, you sacrifice a little of yourself,
willingly, as a knife does, so that you may become better at it.
 
VI.
This is the point at which the invisible body speaks
in italics, the Ouija board of poetry.
 In my mind, says the invisible body, that time capsule shuttlingthrough space, I hold, in all the languages of the world,
 your love, rushed like holographic platters to a table,steaming into the future long after you’ve ceased to shine,
 the silver faces of your beloved bobbing out of the darkness,the black velvet pillow of your life on which you offer them for view.
 
VII.
The invisible body is created out of your longing, your longing
compressing invisible molecules together into an absence you
     recognize.
 
That is the way one blind man sees the world—after the fact,
in photographs he took, once he had passed through it.

people born look like parents,
grandparents, sister or brother,

from an earlier ancestor,
the hawk nose, a hard ridged forehead,
the cleft in the chin or a blue birthmark
on the arm, the stomach,

each unique like a snowflake never
can you guess what’s on their mind
sometimes I can feel what they’re feeling
detect it like hairs on the back of my arms,
together we live, talk, walk the same sidewalks,
to die buried in a foreign cemetery
for others to sit upon ponder their
own light, why am I free, what must I do,
does someone love me like I do,
new skin gives way to wrinkles,
hair fades to gray, bones grow strong
then decay, strength seeps every time

muscles grow then shrink the body

One selfsame figure sits or walks or leans:
We found her hidden just behind those screens,
That mirror gave back all her loveliness.

A nameless girl in freshest summer-greens,
A saint, an angel — every canvas means
The same one meaning, neither more or less.
He feeds upon her face by day and night,
And she with true kind eyes looks back on him,

Three sang of love together: one with lips
   Crimson, with cheeks and bosom in a glow,
Flushed to the yellow hair and finger tips;

   Bloomed like a tinted hyacinth at a show;
And one was blue with famine after love,
   Who like a harpstring snapped rang harsh and low
The burden of what those were singing of.
One shamed herself in love; one temperately
   Grew gross in soulless love, a sluggish wife;
One famished died for love. Thus two of three

Come bounding and surrounding me,
Come buffeting, astounding me,
Nipping and clipping thro’ my wraps and all.

His nose to Russian snows
To be pecked at by every wind that blows?

March with its peck of dust,
Nor April with its rainbow-crowned brief showers,
Nor even May, whose flowers
One frost may wither thro’ the sunless hours.

She stands as pale as Parian statues stand;
Like Cleopatra when she turned at bay,
And felt her strength above the Roman sway,
And felt the aspic writhing in her hand.
Her face is steadfast toward the shadowy land,
For dim beyond it looms the light of day;
Her feet are steadfast; all the arduous way
That foot-track hath not wavered on the sand.
She stands there like a beacon thro' the night,
A pale clear beacon where the storm-drift is;
She stands alone, a wonder deathly white;
She stands there patient, nerved with inner might,
Indomitable in her feebleness,
Her face and will athirst against the light.

1.
I was born on a Tuesday in April.
I didn't cry. Not because I was stunned. I wasn't even mad.
I was the lucky egg, trained for gratitude
inside the belly for nine months straight.
Two workers welded bunk beds at the end
of the delivery room. One on top of the other.
My universe might have been the white lime ceiling,
or the embodiment of Einstein's bent space
in the aluminum springs of the bed above
that curved toward the center.
Neither cold, nor warm.
""It was a clear day,"" my mother told me.
It's hard to believe
there were a few romantic evenings
when I was conceived, a buzz in the retina
and red-laced magma
decadently peeling off
a silver candlestick.
Infants' cries and milk fever
turned to salt from the stench of bleach—
abrasive, unequivocal.
With a piece of cloth wrapped on the end of a stick,
the janitor casually extends the negative space
of the black-and-white tiled floor
like a mouth of broken teeth, a baleen of darkness
sieving out new human destinies.
 
 
2.
1968. At the dock, ships arriving from the East
dumped punctured rice bags, mice
and the delirium of the Cultural Revolution.
A couple of men in uniform
cleared out the church
in the middle of the night.
The locals saw the priest in the yard
wearing only his underwear, shivering from the cold.
Their eyes, disillusioned, questioned one another:
""Wasn't he the one who pardoned our sins?""
 
Icons burned in front of their eyes,
icons and the holy scriptures.
Witnesses stepped farther back,
as if looking at love letters
nobody dared to claim.
 
Crosses were plucked from graves. And from each mouth
spilled irreversible promises:
mounds of dirt the rains would smooth down
sooner or later.
 
Children dragged church bells by the tongue.
(Why didn’t they think of this before?)
Overnight, the dome was demolished, instantly revealing
a myriad of nameless stars that chased the crowd
like flies on a dead horse.
 
And what could replace Sunday mass now?
Women brought cauldrons into the yard.
Men filled up their pipes; smoke rose
into the air, against gravity's pull.
Nails in worn out shoes exposed stigmata
that bled in the wrong places—
a new code of sanctification,
of man, by man.
 
 
3.
""Read!""—I was told. Who said that?
Angel Gabriel, or my first-grade teacher
who had dark roots underneath her bleached curls?
 
Language arrived fragmentary
split in syllables, spasmodic
like code in times of war.
 
""Continue where your classmate left off!""
A long sentence tied us to one another
without connotation as if inside an idiom.
Someone would get to read the noun, another the verb,
a third one a pronoun. . .
I always got the exclamation mark at the end—
a mere grimace, a small curse.
 
A tall cast-iron stove below the portrait of the dictator,
puffing smoke from its temples, enough heat for everyone.
On the blackboard,    
leftover diphthongs from yesterday or the day before
rubbed against one another like kittens.
 
After dusk, I looked for another language outside the window,
my eyes glued to a constellation
(they call these types ""dreamers"")
my discovery possibly a journey into the past,
toward a galaxy already dead, nonexistent,
the kind of news that needs millions of years
to reach me.
 
""Read!""—the angel shook me for a third time
her finger pointing to an arbitrary word
a million light years apart from its object. (It didn't matter who
       was first).
Negative space sketched my onomatopoeic profile
of body and shadow in an accidental encounter.
 
 
4.
Language is erosive.
It makes us recluses,
a wind through the canyons
carving our paleontological eras
for everyone to read.
 
Under the revised testament of my skin
bellows a gold-cast bull, an alluring object,
a need for attention.
Then comes the unleavened bread and a last supper,
which, remarkably, is repeated several times
between ice ages.
Lower yet, Sodom.
I recognize it from the stench of sulfur.
 
I hold my nose. Freud would have done the same.
And then Cain,
a crow taught him how to bury his own brother. . .
And at the bottom,
Adam’s gentlemanlike sin
under which scientists
discover earlier epochs of famine.
 
Between unidentified layers,
wanderings in the sand, the search for a new prophet. . .
 
I try to understand my people.
Their language is plain. Some words,
were actually never uttered, like pages stuck together
in a book fresh off the press
and long after it sits on a shelf.
 
This, too, lives inside me
within insidious bubbles of air, negative
spaces where I can find little historical rest,
but also where utter ruin may originate.
 
5.
Little left of the snow three days ago.
Its blanket ripped away, exposing
dog shit and the bruises of routine.
 
Negative space gives form to the woods
and to the mad woman—a silhouette
of the goddess Athena
wearing a pair of flip flops,
an owl on her shoulder.
 
It’s minus zero. The factory’s gate gnashes its teeth
behind the back of the last worker. Blowing noses, shivering,
     mucus. . .
A virus circulates through the workplace,
secretly, intimately touching one person after another,
a current of sensuality.
It softens the tone.
But nothing unites them more than their frailty,
The one-sizes-fits-all shoes you must grow accustomed to
By filling the extra space with cotton,
Or curling your ill-fitting toes.
 
6.
In Halil’s yard,
rules were sacrilege.
His eight children entertained themselves
by carrying famine on their shoulders,
recalling St. Bartholomew’s flayed skin.
Starving, filthy, hazel-eyed—
three qualities that unexpectedly coalesce
in the bright light, strung together like sneezes.
 
One’s famine was another’s consolation.
“Look at them! It’s a sin for us to complain.
They’re even worse off than us!”
But even Halil found his own consolation
in the old woman Zyra, “barren and paralyzed,”
the root origin of despair.
 
This was our highlands landscape,
hierarchical, where each family
would make out a different expiration date
on the roof below their own.
 Schadenfreude was the only river
that could turn mills.
 
But if this hierarchy shifted,
and our roof gave signs of ruin,
my mother would plant tulips in the garden,
white tulips, our false image,
a scarecrow to keep predators away.
 
 
7.
Nearly nothing was mentioned in the letters he sent from prison,
just two lines, on top of the page:
“I am well. . .” and “If you can,
please send me a pair of woolen socks.”
 
From them, I learned to read between the lines:
negative spaces, the unsaid, gestures,
insomnia that like a hat’s shadow
fails to shade your chin and ears.
 
And in the photographs’ white background,
acrophobia adds to the color of their eyes: blue,
green, gray, and ultimately, chesnut brown,
as, earthward, we lower our gaze.
 
I learned to read the empty spaces the dead left
behind—a pair of folded glasses
after the reading’s done and discourse commences.
 
Or the musical chairs game called ""love,""
where there are less empty seats than people.
If you don’t want to be the last one standing
you must predict when the music will stop.
(Who, though, has really succeeded?)
 
Perhaps a little practice can be useful in this case.
I don’t mean squatting, jumping, stretching,
but listening to the same music every day from the start,
the same miserable vinyl record
so that you’ll recognize its cracks
before it recognizes yours.
 
 
8.
Midnight. Snoring,
meaningless sounds that stain the side of the wall
that belongs to no one.
So where are we? What dimension?
Who foots the bill at a time like this
without lambs or sinners,
when even angels record nothing?
 
The street’s clearly visible
under the neon 24-hour-service sign
above the funeral home.
There was a music shop next to it
that closed down a few months ago;
the shop shared a wall with the funeral home,
shared the same water pipes and the same gate to heaven.
But the coffins won,
the wide-shouldered coffins that narrow down
in the shape of a mummy, not a human.
Wood of the highest quality, swears the owner,
and pure silk inside, pleated like a stomach
that can digest even a bulldozer.
 
When asleep we're simply five limbs. Starfish.
If you cut one limb, it will grow back.
Even a single limb could recreate us from the beginning,
     a single hope.
Negative space is always fertile.
 
 
9.
No one knows if it was simply a matter of mixed
or some other reason why I used to see
what I wasn't supposed to see—
the ending of things.
It wasn’t a mystical gift, but like a blood clot
in the darkness of a vein, I held on to reason,
as it circulated from the bottom up
and not the other way around as we were told.
I used to start from the edges
and with my left hand or a croupier’s stick
gather the balls and dice from the corners
and then watch the bettors
as neither a winner nor a loser.
There's nothing sillier
than watching a film in reverse
where after the climax, the protagonists
are replaced by circumstances,
and circumstances replaced by minor characters,
their tongues plastered behind a single, fatal smirk
Life and my short lunar calendar slipped away
like carbon paper sending off as much light as necessary,
skipping the details, the contrast and sharp colors.
Lunar time is short. Until the actual end,
there are years enough, the negative spaces.
What to do with them when the verb
has already been uttered, a conclusive sentence
with Latin syntax, or more than that:
didactic.

                ","
I grew up in a big house
where weakness and expressions of joy
deserved punishment.
And I was raised on the via politica
with the grease of yesterday’s glories,
a thick grease collected under arctic skies.
I was lit up. My notebooks, my hair, my heart reeked of
smoke.
 
That’s when we saw each other clearly.
Or rather, what remained of us.
Damaged like lottery numbers
scratched away with a blade.
 
How different we were!
 
Those with round faces were righteous;
those with narrow faces were cautious.
 
One listened secretly to Puccini,
another to silence, the music’s music.
The oldest one declaimed monologues
inside a ten-by-ten-foot cell
he had built for himself.
 
And the mysterious one
simply had diabetes.
 
But how similar we were in severe circumstances!
 
Alarmed like a flock of magpies
that the smallest stone sends into the sky
toward the mouth of the abyss.
 
Then it became obvious there wasn’t enough space for everyone.
We separated. Some went on living in via verbum,
telling of what they knew, what they witnessed,
and so, through their narrative,
creating their own grease.
 
The others crossed over the ocean.
 
And those in particular who went farthest away
never speak of their annoying history
of wretched survival, burying it
in the darkest crevices on their being.
Unfortunately, as with perfume, its scent
lingers there for much, much longer.

                    Acupuncture
                ","
Among the personal objects inside a 2100-year-old Chinese tomb,
archaeologists found nine acupuncture needles,
four gold and five silver.
Long before knowing why,
ancient doctors knew that pain
must be fought with pain.
 
It’s quite simple: an array of needles pricking your arm
for a properly functioning heart and lungs.
Needles in the feet to ease insomnia and stress.
Needles between your eyes to fight infertility.
A little pain here,
and the effect is felt elsewhere
Once, a group of explorers set out to plant a flag on the South
      Pole,
a needle at the heel of the globe, in the middle of nowhere.
But before the mission was completed
a new world war had begun.
The impact of the needle was felt in the world’s brain,
in the lobe responsible for short-term memory.
When Russia used ideology as acupuncture—a needle over the
     Urals—
it impacted the pancreas and the control of blood sugar:
America paid tenfold for whiskey during Prohibition,
and at post offices, copies of Joyce’s
“immoral” Ulysses were stored for burning.
The universe functions as a single body. Stars form lines of
     needles
carefully pinned to a broad hairy back.
Their impact is felt in the digestive tract, each day
a new beginning. How can you begin a new day
not having fully absorbed yesterday’s protein?
I was a child when my first teacher
mispronounced my last name twice. That pricked me
      like a needle.
A small needle in the earlobe. And suddenly,
my vision cleared—
I saw poetry,
the perfect disguise.

""The wild will keep calling and calling forever in your ears. You
cannot escape the 'little voices.'""
—Frank Wild



1.
Here I rest, in South Georgia.
A few feet of evolution away
lie the graves of whale hunters, pointing north.
A white fence shields them from elephant seals
and their apocalyptic screams that each day warn
of the end of the world, or maybe the beginning. . .
 
I survived five expeditions to the Pole.
The one before last, “Imperial Trans-Antarctica,” nearly killed me.
For two years I put up with the ice—no man can reap or sow
       these fields.
And, unlike farmers, I didn’t even need to ask God for rain,
because ice is sated
and more desolate than the Sahara.
 
I survived distance. Wrote one message after another
beginning with a capital letter and a ""PS."" at the end.
My own personal post office under my pillow
closed for two years already, on holiday.
 
I survived six month-long polar days and nights;
to this day, I don't know which one was worse.
 
My epitaph is simple. Carved in granite:
                         FRANK WILD
                         18 April 1873
                         19 August 1939
                         “Shackleton’s
                          Right Hand Man”
From those cast away here
by a defect in the engine of the ship
or nostalgia of the womb.
 
2.
Ah yes. . . in the beginning was the ship. The ship stuck in ice.
      Endurance. 
Ships are women. They prefer soft seas.
In the best-case scenario, she’s called La Santa Maria 
and she throws you, like Columbus, on some foreign shore.
 
But if you get too close to her. . .
 
The very day after
we washed her deck with warm water and soap,
warmed her arteries with gin,
stroked her lower back with our surrogate songs,
shaved our beards and exposed the illiterate lines on our faces,
she took off.
 
And from the shore,
we saw how she broke her ribs, sinking,
aft first, so fast we didn’t even have time to pray,
leaving behind her ash-tree fragrance
and faux pearls on the water.
 
“Such a woman!” someone laughed bitterly,
“She knows when to leave so as not to be forgotten.”
 
3.
A woman, naturally, has no business there.
Antarctica is a masculine continent—
male penguins keep the eggs warm,
the moon stands up on the street to urinate
after being kicked out of the tavern,
the cold like a cut-throat razor, dulled for three thousand years,
and the sled dogs, the Huskies,
we kill with a single bullet
so they won’t starve to death. In this way
we instill a little character into the new land
before the arrival of Conquistadors, thieves,
assassins, missionaries, prostitutes,
the first invading army of every continent.
 
Antarctica is a man’s continent,
because only a man chooses to break into the darkness of the mind
by conquering the body,
as Amundsen and Scott did, their glory
reaching to the apex of ecstasy.
Zero degree of geographical latitude,
utter collapse.
 
4.
Hunger is overestimated. The stomach functions much like the
     brain:
when it has nothing to think about, it feeds off memories.
It can last three days just thinking of a single biscuit.
But those who have a better memory, meaning a much stronger
     acidity,
can go on for months
remembering a slice of prosciutto, two fried eggs,
sweetly folding their eyelids like napkins after a meal.
 
Then hallucinations begin. Banquets. Easter supper.
Feet move impatiently under the table;
the scent of rosemary wafts from a platter
and two clean serving hands with burns here and there.
That's when you feel grief-stricken
and you attack the seals and penguins with your
alpine knives and shoes like a madman
in an empty amphitheater.
Or is this, too, a hallucination,
and in this case not ours
but Antarctica's?
 
And when clarity finally returns,
both stomach and brain
notice only their own deep wrinkles.
 
 
5.
Blubber, blubber, seal's blubber.
Blubber that keeps your spirits alive, rendering it for fuel, for light,
blubber to mask the body's foul odor,
—a mixture of doubt, hope, and ammonia.
And if you have nothing better to do,
think of a cow's thigh hanging at the butcher's,
its delicate streak of fat
like a silk ribbon.
 
I survived even this sarcasm.
 
And every night, before bed,
we read recipes to each other
one of a few things we secretly rescued
from the ship before she sank,
as if these items were her lingerie.
 
What a show it was!
What pathos in pronouncing prosciutto, sugar, omelet!
What sensuality in milk, parsley, cinnamon!
We made these words up ourselves.
Nothing exists until its moment of absence.
 
But first, in order to warm up our mouths
like actors before going on stage,
we'd repeat mechanically, palates dry,
""Bless us, O Lord,
and this food we've received through your mercy.”
 
 
6.
It was the Romans who spoiled the word
studying rhetoric
before anatomy and mathematics:Vir bonus dicendi peritus
“The good man skilled in speaking"" (Marcus Porcius Cato)
 
But in Antarctica, words are measured differently: by calories!
With a simple greeting you lose five calories,
just as many to keep a fire burning for a full minute.
And a Ciceronian argument can consume a whole day’s
      nutrition;
think carefully before you open your mouth.
 
The word is overestimated.
 
Sometimes it’s enough to avert your eyes from your shoes
to imply “gangrene”;
and a vague exchange of glances between men
is enough to understand that the ice is cracking beneath your feet
and death is closer than your fingers.
 
7.
Stretched smooth from end to end—such is Antarctica. In fact,
even a baby’s skin looks withered by comparison.  
No emotions. No regrets. No warnings.
Either fight or die.
 
My father was like this more or less. A teacher at a village school.
In classrooms that smelled of sheep-wool pullovers
drying on the body. And eyes that moved freely
in their hollows, like toes
inside an older sibling’s shoes.
 
Unlike the Romans,
my father preached about justice and honor
his hands folded behind his back.
His shoulders seemed twice as wide
as his worn jacket.
 
I inherited his sharp, gray gaze
and his soft voice.
Eyes that say “Go” and a voice that says “Stay.”
You never know which one to trust.
 
 
8.
And mother? Oh, she was simply Captain Cook’s niece,
—the great James Cook—
from morning to night
when she washed, swept, dug potatoes from the garden,
fixed her husband’s tie on Sundays
even from her bed, while in labor.
She never spoke of this. As it wasn’t necessary.
People speak of what they have, not what they are.
 
She was a tailor. Measured everyone's perimeter with a glance;
erred only on the width of one’s neck, an unknown strength.
Her large scissors followed
the white chalk line on the cloth so precisely. ""Snip!""
She said little. Her silence followed the white outlines
of another tailor,
over a fabric much older than she was.
 
But now that I think of it,
how did the poor woman respond to her friends asking,
""Where is your son?""
""He's exploring the world.""
""And what does he bring back from there?""
""Himself, alive, I hope.""
""What's the point of returning empty-handed after two years?”
 
Was she at least a little proud of me? Of her Frank?
Certainly not. She was Captain Cook's niece.
The past always conquers.
 
 
9.
I was the first of thirteen children.
And as a rule, each of them
eyed one of my belongings.
One eyed my bed near the window
that overlooked the water where frogs lived
and asparagus grew on the shore.
Another eyed my green jacket bought with borrowed money,
poker cards, a fishing net,
my wicker chair with the damaged back.
Another whistled my favorite tune:
""What Will We Do with a Drunken Sailor?”
without reaching the refrain.
And yet another envied the basement
—that place I occupied in my father’s heart—
 with its elm door hanging by a single hinge.
 
But the time hasn't come to leave home just yet,
until your own brother begins to use your shaving kit
and dreams of the same girl.
 
 
10.
What shaving kit? Antarctica makes you grow a double-beard
as if you were a hundred-year-old grave.
And, while you remember wasting time waiting in line at
      barber's
another beard grows, a red one.
 
Here, each body part works for itself:
the stomach, hands, intestines, eyes. . .
The unity of the body is overestimated, too.
 
Only skin pulls everything together like a sled.
The skin? Which skin? Man loses his first skin
to his first love, like the snake early in spring
on a thorn-apple bush that blocks the way.
From that point on he stops counting the rest.
 
11. 
I don’t know why it was named “Elephant Island,”
when it answered the ocean with the cries of a she-wolf.
We could only make out her sly teats under her belly. After
      some time,
if she didn’t kill us first, we’d begin to cry like wolves ourselves.
 
Twenty-two people. Packed next to one another under two
      inverted boats
like notes in Bach’s “Come, Sweet Death, Come Blessed Rest,”
with more pauses, a dramatic suffocation between breaths.
A dry, calcic cough was a sign of life. Or the delirious mutterings
        of someone
dreaming aloud of “ice” in the middle of ice,
after they had cut off his toes.
 
But the hardest moment arrives in the morning,
when, with shut eyes and plugged nostrils,
as if drinking your own urine
you recycle the same lie for four months straight:
“Men, pack up your stuff! The boss might arrive today!”
 
And they obeyed me. Packed carefully each day from the start,
leaving nothing shap in the folds of their bags,
nothing that would spoil the line between fact and fiction.
 
It was a time when
routine grew more powerful than hope.
 
 
12.
Fish in the ocean toyed with our citizenship.
On the seventh mile, we left our medals behind, class ranks,
along with the dogs, potatoes, and a camera.
We made fire out of money
and kept only a single metal coin each
so that archaeologists might trace us more easily centuries later.
On Elephant Island, we had to bid farewell even to tobacco,
tobacco which reminded us of village alleyways
and walks home after midnight.
 
Time glided above us without touching a single strand of our
     hair—
nonexistent, as if gliding above ancient cities,
exposing the solemnity of our white bones
and crickets on absent walls.
 
That’s when the ten commandments deserted us:
“Do not steal,” “Do not lie,” “Do not covet,”
“Honor your parents”. . .
save one of them perhaps,
the one about the holiness of Sunday.
 
We already had nothing. We belonged to no one.
An entirely new species: HOMO ANTARCTICUS.
A scientific proof that “forgotten” and “free”
mean the same thing.
 
 
13.
Two years after returning from the world of the dead,
you find your house taken over by another tenant
and the rent tripled,
the commemorative plaque nailed to the gate:
“Here lived F.W.”
And your lover, or better, ex-lover,
for the same reason,
in the arms of another
three times more handsome.
 
You see your own image sold at an auction.
Artifact. Original. “Brrramp. Sold!” The price so high
you can’t afford it. But even if you could,
you're an illegal customer,
holding a death certificate in your hand.
 
And you find your parents turned into winter trees
their eyes fixed on a large cloud of plaster.
They don’t expect visitors. Best not disturb them.
Let their leaves fall quietly where they will
let the crow's nest remain in the armpit of a branch,
where it has always been.
 
Perhaps you should take a shortcut, start over.
Or you know what? There’s a war going on nearby, they say.
Go there instead!
But this time die better.
 
 
14.
War’s never satisfied with flesh;
Fresh, branded, smoked,
with or without blood
blue blood, dark, thick, whatever kind.
And frozen blood like yours
could store at minus 40 degrees Celsius,
viruses from 1914 unscathed,
and the map of the old Empire         
and Scott's hurt ego 
and old coins minted with the head of Edward VII,
and Browning’s poetry and the epic of the unknown,
like an envelope inside an envelope,
all making you the ideal candidate.
 
Back on the ship, ammunition everywhere,
sailing through the cold Northern seas
where you had to learn a new language.
A new language is like a fish:
first, you need to remove its spine
in order to chew it.
 
Unlike in Antarctica,
one’s purpose in war is clear: kill or be killed,
though sometimes it’s the same difference.
 
Baltic nights gave you what Antarctica refused you:
the other half of the celestial sphere.
You meet Vera, the widow of a tea plantation owner,
a character out of a Baroque novel, her pupils blurred with dusk,
and the ritual of mourning fitted perfectly to her body
like a final journey. 
 
 
15.
A man charmed by a glacier,
who knows too well the flawless forms of her body,
feels her eavesdropping gaze even when asleep,
her clean and distant breath
and her heart, a piece of ice, that melts inside a cigarette case
heated for drinking water,
finds it difficult to marry a real woman,
to marry Vera.
And Africa.
 
I bought land. Barren. Hundreds of acres. In Zululand.
I didn’t fare well with tobacco. Planted cotton instead,
chose bodily peace rather than meditation.
My nearest neighbor lived 45 miles away. White, of course.
And my fate, never blended with the blacks,
those beautiful statues, wrapped in straw.
I heard them nod off during lunch break,
like the oars of a boat,
in complete sync.
They knew where they were heading.
But I didn’t.
 
And I was right. It didn’t take long
before drought, floods, worms
destroyed everything. The bank left me only my own beard
and the malarial shadow of a baobab. Apart from other things,
Vera filled out divorce papers. The woman in the yellow dress,
yellow as quinine, yellow as the sigh of a hinge at dusk,
the woman married to the hero
who now can’t even manage a small plot of land.
 
 
16.
The man in front of me
—my master I call ""Boss""—
is newly shaved, and dressed in a striped tie and jacket
as if the Prince of Wales or Fred Astaire,
a style that arrives here two years late.
He asks me to serve whiskey to clients at the bar
and chat them up
using their jargon, gestures,
sentences uninterrupted by mosquitoes,
and the abstract rhetoric of the Depression years.
And, to be frank,
he pays me for the latter.
 
But what do I know,
what does a survivor know about the art of living,
for which new instincts are needed, new muscles
and other kinds of heart valves?
 
Furthermore,
how can I obey such a spick-and-span boss,
having known the smoky gods of Antarctica
who recognize each other solely by the nose
and can end rebellions with a glance
and count the deaths as members of the crew?
How can I take orders from a boss whose name isn't Shackleton?
 
 
17.
""Second in command,” “Lieutenant,” “Shackleton’s right hand”
 
What did she see so clearly in me,
my drama teacher in elementary school
when she'd always assign me the role of Father Joseph,
of Gaspar the Magi offering Jesus frankincense,
or of John the Baptist always there to clear the path?
What did she see in my metallic pupils, baritone voice,
      infrequent speech
as if scissors, bandage, and iodine
inside a first aid kit?
 
Under Antarctica's naked sky, each of us followed his own star.
Even the carpenter, his own heraldic calling.
You didn’t need much to feed them;
 just a few crusts of insomnia and the tents' punctured holes.
 
My star was weak; you could hardly see it
hidden behind another larger, troubled star
like a calm valley that appears behind jagged peaks
more attractive when absent.
 
 
18.
What happened afterward can be told in a few words:
I worked in a mine; earth’s warm heart,
happened to be crueler than her frozen brain.
I laid railroad tracks South, always toward the Unknown.
It was like playing only two strings on a violin: joy and sorrow,
fatefully blending at the horizon.
 
I repaired houses. Another waste of time.
I never understood their weak points,
just as you can't make out eyes from genitals or mouth
in some underwater creatures.
 
And when I was left penniless,
I gave lectures about Antarctica,
water gurgling in my gullet every five words, for those few
who listened patiently to an adventure of survival.
 
Then Bea arrived. Or sweet Beatrice.
It was easy to grant her what I had left in my heart
—that set of heavy museum keys—
with no fear she might lose them.
 
Tired lungs and liver
could barely follow my split image
of bust and bottle of booze.
Like a prophet in the last circle of Dante’s Inferno,
I carried my own decapitated head in hand.
 
My ashes were lost at the base of a church. No one
      thought of them.
It was a time of war. Another world war. The second
one not knowing what to do with her own ashes either.
 
19.
Some of us died in the war.  Others took to the sea again,
the gray, cracked waters of the South,
decks perspiring fuel and alcohol.
Our random itineraries. Full-time melancholics.
 
For months in Antarctica,
we waited for our shadow to return
and consumed that question you ask yourself only once in your
     lifetime,
the way one consumes chickenpox.
 
And the rest of the time,
we counted the scars left on our faces,
with a gesture you could call indifferent and epic,
or childlike.

Yesterday I saw myself die again // Fifty times I died in Orlando // &

I was studying at NYU // where he was teaching // where he wrote shit
                        That made me feel like a queer brown survival was possible // But he didn’t
Survive & now // on the dancefloor // in the restroom // on the news // in my chest
                        There are another fifty bodies that look like mine // & are
Dead // & I’ve been marching for Black Lives & talking about police brutality
                        Against Native communities too // for years now // but this morning
I feel it // I really feel it again // How can we imagine ourselves // We being black native
                        Today // Brown people // How can we imagine ourselves
When All the Dead Boys Look Like Us? // Once I asked my nephew where he wanted
                        To go to College // What career he would like // as if
The whole world was his for the choosing // Once he answered me without fearing
                        Tombstones or cages or the hands from a father // The hands of my lover
Yesterday praised my whole body // Made angels from my lips // Ave Maria
                        Full of Grace // He propped me up like the roof of a cathedral // in NYC
Before we opened the news & read // & read about people who think two brown queers
                        Can’t build cathedrals // only cemeteries // & each time we kiss
A funeral plot opens // In the bedroom I accept his kiss // & I lose my reflection
                        I’m tired of writing this poem // but I want to say one last word about
Yesterday // my father called // I heard him cry for only the second time in my life
                        He sounded like he loved me // it’s something I’m rarely able to hear
& I hope // if anything // his sound is what my body remembers first.

You can't fake it. You know when I fail
          to achieve the expected: palm the becoming-
                         comatose bullfrog, legs collapsing as they may,
and chuck it (we used to say) high as you can.
 
Let it fly stone-like to the skylight in the low
          dome of fog—another requirement of the game:
                    a foggy day and a bullfrog and you, Vincent.
The old code goes back and forth between us
 
as we take our turns, childhood pals, engaged
           by the game we once called Kamikaze—now,
                         a nameless ceremony. Nameless not because
a boy's play calcifies in a man's conviction;
 
not because, despite our promise, you've become
          a mid-rank fighter pilot, and I a minor poet;
                        and not because it's too unpleasant to name
what brings to hand that astonished muscle
 
only to leave it, later, sprawled on the current.
          The perfect toss sends the critter shattering
                         for an instant, beyond fog, into the invisible.
Disappearance is success. Once you said, ""My insides
 
tickle whenever it happens,"" and so I know
          you've been tickled five times, and I three.
                    That's the score; the score matters little.
The name is gone because we're from here,
 
and, being native, cannot visit how it is
         that an urge to which we tend tends to us—
                       how we are cruel, inscrutable, indefensible,
yet holy. How we send up bodies of praise from
 
our right hand, only to gather eventual elegies—
          flesh stunned still as words—in our left.
                    Once again the center of the heavens
is earth. We've thrown as high as we can
 
for as long as we can remember, only to await
          some return: a revelation, plummet, explosive
                         splash. So it is that two grown men
may stand again in stillness, awaiting word,
 
friends who glimpse for seconds at a time
          earth as it is in heaven, ankle-deep
                          in Rowan Creek with eyes uplifted,
reflecting the fog to the fog itself.

I'd seek your favor, for an instant, then die—
     if only you would grant my wish.
I'd place my spirit in your hand,
     then sleep—and in that sleep find sweetness.
 
I wander from you—and die alive;
     the closer I cling—I live to die.
How to approach I still don't know,
     nor on what words I might rely.
Instruct me, Lord: advise and guide me.
     Free me from my prison of lies.
 
Teach me while I can bear the affliction—
     do not, Lord, despise my plea;
before I've become my own burden
     and the little I am weighs on me,
and against my will, I give in
     as worms eat bones that weary of me.
 
I'll come to the place my forefathers reached,
     and by their place of rest find rest.
Earth's back to me is foreign;
     my one true home is in its dust.
Till now my youth has done what it would:
     When will I provide for myself?
 
The world He placed in my heart has kept me
     from tending to my end and after.
How could I come to serve my Lord,
     when I am still desire's prisoner?
How could I ask for a place on high,
     when I know the worm will be my sister?
 
How at that end could my heart be glad,
     when I do not know what death will bring?
Day after day and night after night
     reduce the flesh upon me to nothing.
Into the winds they'll scatter my spirit.
     To dust they'll return the little remaining.
 
What can I say—with desire my enemy,
     from boyhood till now pursuing me:
What is Time to me but your Will?
     If you're not with me, what will I be?
I stand bereft of any virtue:
     only your justice and mercy shield me.
 
But why should I speak, or even aspire?

                ","
When is a poem one word? Even at 17 he was Baraka
           on the court, Coltrane gold toned, a kind of running riff,
more than boy-child, man-child, he was one word like Prince.
            How back in those drunken days when I still
ran in bars & played schoolyard ball
            & wagered fives & tens, me & my colleague
the psych-prof drove across Eastern Ohio
             just to see this kid from powerhouse St. Vincent,
grown out of rust-belt-bent-rims, tripped
            with the hype & hope & hip hop
blaring from his headphones, all rubber soled
            & grit as the city which birthed him.
We watched him rise that night scoring over 35,
            drove back across the quiet cut cornfields
& small towns of Ohio, back to the places
            where we slept knowing that Jesus had been reborn, black
& beautiful with a sweatband crown rimming his brow.
            He was so much more than flipping burgers & fries,
more than 12-hour shifts at the steel plant in Cleveland.
            More than the shut-down mill in Youngstown.
More than that kid selling meth in Ashtabula.
            He was every kid, every street, every silo, he was white
& black & brown & migrant kids working farms.
            He was the prince of stutter-step & pause. He was the new
King. We knew he was coming back the day after he left
            his house in Bath Township. He never sold it.
Someone fed his fish for years. Perhaps our hope? Fuck Miami.
Leave Wade to wade through the Hurricane rain. LeBron is
remembering that woman washing the linoleum floor, that man
          punching his punch card. He drives a Camaro, the cool kid
Ohio car driving through any Main Street. He is the toll-taker, &
            he is the ticket out.
He keeps index cards documenting
            his opponents’ moves. One leans forward before he drives.
One always swipes with his left hand. The details like a preacher
            studying the gospel. He studies the game like a
mathematician conjugating equations, but when he moves he is a
            choreography,
a conductor passing the ball like a baton. He is a burst of cinders
            at the mill. He is a chorus of children calling his name.
            The blistered hands of man stacking boxes
in Sandusky, the long wait for work in Lorain.
A sapling bends
            & reaches in all directions
before it becomes a tree. A ball is a key to a lock.
            A ball is the opposite of Glock.
America who sings your praises,
           while tying the rope, everyone waiting for Caesar to fall,
back-stabbing media hype city betrayed
            by white people with racist signs.
            I watch the kids play ball
in the Heights, witness this they say. We will rise. I watched
            LeBron arrive & leave, I walked, I gave up drinking
as he went off & won a ring. The children’s chorus calls out sing
            brother, sing. Everything is black. Storm clouds gather
out on Lake Erie. But the old flower-hatted women
            at the Baptist church are heading out praise cards,
registering teenagers to vote. To turn a few words into a sentence.
He is a glossary of jam, & yes he is corporate
            chugging down green bubbly Sprite, running in Beats head
phones, he is Dunkin his donut, he is Nike, witness, ripped.
            On a spring day in Akron a
            chorus of children is chanting his name on the court by the
chain-link fence. He is forged steel, turning his skinny body into
            muscle, years of nights lifting, chiseling, cutting, studying.
Watching the tape. To make a new kind of sentence. He is passing
            out T-shirts, this long hot bloody summer he was returned
to the rusted rim along the big lake. He is stutter-step. He is
            spinning wheel. He has a cool new hat. He is speaking of dead
black children. He is giving his time. To make the crowd
            sway like wind through a field of corn.
            Does LeBron think of dying?
            Does the grape think of dying as it withers on the vine by
the lake? Or does it dream of the wine it will become?
He is wearing a shirt that says I Can’t Breathe.
They said he was arrogant. I said he was just Ohio.
            He married his high school sweetheart. Bravado laid out
on the court. No back down, he is Biggie with a basketball inside
            of a mic, no ballistics, just ballet. He is Miles Davis cool,
quietly cerebral, turning his back, tossing up
            chalk like blue smoke, blue notes, blues. He is Akron,
Columbus, he is heart & Heat turned to lake effect blizzards,
            freighters frozen in ice, looking for work & no money to eat.
He is Ashtabula & Toledo. He is carrying so many across the
            river, up through Marietta.
            The grapevines are ripe in Geneva.
            He returns, Man-child, Man-strong, Man-smart, Man-
mountain, Mansfield to East Akron, minus into Man, or should we
            say Mamma raised? Single mother fed, shy child, quiet child
who grew, who suffered & taught his body to sing, his

never gave up for her son. He is third shift at the rubber
            plant in winter, he is farm hands & auto parts piecework
& long nights the men at the bar, eyes on the television.
            The lake tonight is black as newly laid asphalt.

In the next room, Peter’s gloved hands crack
cordoned-off spines: he has been granted
permission, his agent’s call his pedigree.
So the tour itself is only the docent and me.
He is docile, eager to please, leads me
up the stairs and takes me to the bed.The coverlet is authentic, he says.
He lectures me on the heating system, offers
an anecdote of a broken casserole, recites
all of the Welty lore he has rehearsed.
She taught him when he was young, and now
he serves her legend, lets me lean in
toward the books—I cross the line
of what’s allowed, never touching.
He shows me photos—two loves lost, one
a married man—then on the way down,
pauses before a feather in a box,
reciting Yeats’s “Leda and the Swan.”
He begins to weep at Let her drop, adds,Like Welty’s loves! Now I stop—
is he comparing her to the god, or Leda?
He cannot bear her, her Unfulfilled Love.
I cannot bear this either—how dare he conjure up
for her such disappointment, such wasted longing?
I want to be the mirror of her photographs,
to be her figure of my own conjuring. I want
to believe I, too, could be happy here, in this
solitary house, in this small town, amidst
the rows and stacks of books. Untouched.

                    Being Serious
                ","
I.
Serious smiles a lot.
At least that’s what they say,
His Mum and Pop
Trying to be proud
As all the nurses gather round
To squint into the cloud
Of little Serious on the ultrasound.It’s likely just the way he’s bent,
The head nurse finally thunders
Into the awe and argument
Swirling through the crowd
Where someone mutters half-aloudIn all my years…
 
Serious never hears.
Serious spins and spins
With his dumb dolphin grin
In the best bed there is,
Where there’s no guilt and no sin,
No child more inner than this;
Nothing to will
And nothing to want,
No body you both are and haunt;
No drug of disappointment
Or feeling that there’s never now
(Or do these seep in somehow?);
No suffering the world’s idiocy
 
Like a saint its pains;
No traffic and no planes;
No debts, no taxes,
No phones and no faxes;
No rockslide of information
Called the Internet.
 
Serious isn’t. Yet.
 
 
2.
Serious hears a sound.
Not unusual, in itself, nothing to be concerned about.
Here and there there’s been a shout,
A song he seemed to be inside,
The weird whale-calls of her gas.
This, too, shall pass.
 
Then it comes again,
And with a far-off force
Which a shrink less serious than he
Will have him dream is a drain
That all his impurity
Is slowly drifting toward(Down, Serious says, down!) 
Beyond which he’ll be clean,
Feel no pain…
 
Then the dark erupts in a rain
Of blood and muck
He seems to mostly be,
Holding on for all he’s worth,
Which isn’t much, finally,
Little wizened thing
Plopping out to an earth
Where cries of agony
Dwindle to equivocal joy(It’s, it’s…is it a boy?) 
And some clear world lies
Just beyond the eyes
You can’t quite open;
 
And everything is wet,
And loud, and broken;
And all of life is one huge tit
You’re meant to somehow suck.
 
Serious staggers to his feet,
Slaps himself harder than the doctor did
And says, I’m fucked.
 
 
3.
Serious is learning silence
In the way most children learn to speak.Poshlust!
He gasps after his first feeding,Götterdämmerung in his first dusk,
His whole body writhing with a kind of violence
As if the world had wounded him,
Words his bleeding.
 Anomie, Deus absconditus
Drift into the air above his crib;Accursed progenitor, quintessence of dust
Dribble with the pap onto his bib;
As day by day, and week by week,
Serious wrestles with this difficult gift,
Forgetting, which, it seems, he is on this earth to do.
 Boob, ass, oaf,
Riving out of him like greatness going off;Ninny, crackpate, clunkhead, gorm,
Leaving him gasping and bent;fragments, sheep, rabble,
All falling, falling from him
Backwards into babble...
 
Finally Serious lies there, spent,
Language like some immense ghostly mobile
Bobbing just above his bed,
All power of movement gone as well:
 
Useless little buglike arms, buglike little fingers,
This heavy, heavy head.
 
And now if there’s something Serious can’t quite taste,
Or if he feels too acutely his own waste,
Or knows too acutely what he can’t tell,
He screams and screams
Until the world knows what Serious means.
 
 
4.
Serious goes to school.Just try it, his Mum says
As she lets go his hand
And wipes a last glaze
Of doughnut from his nose,
And Serious, insofar as Serious can,
Does give it a good try,
Though it’s hard to understand
Why they keep taking a break
From taking breaks, or why
They can’t simply walk
In line down the hall,
Or what, finally, is at stake
In a game of kickball.
 
It’s time to draw a tree.
What a relief to work alone,
Serious thinks, as he picks a scab
For just the right tinge of sky,
Breaks his sugar cookie
To make a place of stone,
And fashions out of bread
A man with a huge head
And huge, ruined wings,
Gasping at all the ruined things
To which he’s tumbled.
And calls it: Cookie, Crumbled.
 Oh my, the teacher says
When she walks by,Those are interesting trees. 
Serious closes his eyes and sees
As in a vision of doom
Himself drowning in schools,
A whole ocean of fools
Nipping, nipping at him
With their tiny, tiny teeth.
And Serious sighs
With a prophet’s wisdom
As he climbs up into his seat,
Stares out across the room
And like a prophet cries:You’re all going to die!
 
The class is a tomb.
Serious, rigid, waits.
A girl in pigtails giggles,
Then another near the back.
And as if along a fuse
The giggling goes
Up and down the rows
Till someone makes a crack
About his coat and tie
And the laughter detonates.
 
Serious climbs slowly down
Into that inferno of sound
Which the teacher’s shouts
Are only driving higher,
Packs up his lunchbox, his dignity,
And his copy of Sartre,
 
And strides with a prophet’s gaze
Through all that derisive fire.
Only once does he turn,
Briefly, to look back through the blaze
At the iron fact of his art,
Smaller from here, but unburned.
 
 
5.
Serious loves his Mum.
And then he doesn’t, quite.
It’s that way with everything—
Baths and plums,
The blessèd silence of night.
 Would you like to help with this?
His mother asks
As she rolls out biscuit dough
And cuts it with a glass
Or folds the clothes
Still warm from the sun.
But Serious knows
He was born with a task,
And though he touches the clothes
And tastes the dough,
Serious says, No.
 
Serious stays in the bath
Until his skin is shriveled and cold,
Eats himself sick on plums,
Feels in the dark
The dark he becomes,
And cries out in the night for his Mum.
 
 
6.
Serious is older now.
He just is.Thank God, Serious says,
For whom childhood, that stupid carousel that never stops,
Always had an element of disingenuousness:
The tristesse of lollipops,
The sham of naps;
Fools dandling you on their laps
So you can play horsey, which damn sure isn’t serious;
And all that endless business
Of pretending to be curious
About the most obvious things:
What’s night? Where’s Mama-Cat?
What’s wrong with Pop? Can God die?
Why, why, why?
 
To hell with that,
Serious thinks, as he sits incinerating memories
One by one,
Saying their names as he feeds them
Like photographs to a fire:
Here he is in a baseball uniform
Squinting back the sun;
Here in a blue tuxedo with a ruffled front;
And here, Lord, with pimples.
He pauses a moment.
Do memories have names?
And what, exactly, are these flames?
To hell with that!
Done.
 
Serious owns a car, pays taxes,
Contemplates a pension,
Has a crease of gray along his temples,
But he is young, young.
He develops headaches, begins sleeping badly, and relaxes,
You might say, into the constant tension
That he really always was,
With far, far too much to do
To look anywhere but onward,
Or to answer the questions of a child
With anything true.
 
 
7.
Serious isn’t Stupid,
Though they go to the same gym.
Serious sees him dropping weights
Or picking his butt and thinks,
At least I’m not him.
Nor is he Mean or Vain,
Those chiseled twins
With matching boots and belts,
Nor Smug who notes their sins,
Nor Shallow noting something else;
He isn’t useless Timid
Who no matter what won’t complain,
Nor fat-assed Nice sweating honey
On all the machines,
Nor Self-Loathing who smudges mirrors,
Nor Whacked who licks them clean.
Serious isn’t Funny.
 
Serious spreads his towel on the bench,
Sits down in front of his own image,
And Serious strains at a serious weight.
And never, not once, when he’s seen
In myriad mirrors around the room
That everyone else is straining too,
Has he caught himself too late
And finished with a roar
And more strength
Than he’s ever had before:I AM NOT YOU!
 
 
8.
Serious has a date with Doom.
It’s not the first, and seems unlikely to be the last,
For they get on quite well, Doom and he,
Share similar pasts
And similar ideas about what life should be.
It seems, in fact, that this might just bloom.
 
And what a relief.
After Morose and Mad and Neurotic;
After almost falling for Grief,
Who was so exotic
She made all the others seem tame.
Then to discover she even lied about her name.
And to sleep with another Serious! That was odd,
Like wrestling with an angel,
Though it was hard to tell from that rough unsated tangle
Which one was Serious, and which one God.
 
But how easy it is to be himself with Doom,
Serious thinks, as he puts the wine in to chill
And sets two glasses on a tray,
Who always wants whatever Serious wants
And always agrees with what he has to say;
Who doesn’t need to hear that whole spiel
About “going too fast” or “needing more room”;
And who doesn’t probe and pry that long needle into his brain
—What do you feel? What do you feel?—
Until it’s all Serious can do not to stand up and scream: Pain!
 
Lucky to be alive.
And if he still has no clear idea where she lives,
And never knows quite when she’ll arrive,
Still, something about Doom feels right
To Serious, and he looks forward to their dates.
He checks himself in the mirror, dims the light,
And waits.
 
 
9.
Serious is a traveler.
“Traveling broadens the mind,”
The man beside him says,
His tray table down and seat reclined
Even as they're taking off,
And Serious, who has his eyes closed
So he can do what Serious does,
Begins to cough.
 
               What do they say, what do they fear, 
               Is this song joy or grief? 
               This is a man, this is a god. 
               Who are you and why are you here? 
               To leave, to leave.
 
The meal is over,
Which Serious declined.
In the shell-roar of the cabin
He eases somewhat, is surprised to find
He could almost drift away.
“What line of work are you in?”
He hears the man beside him say,
And Serious begins coughing wildly again.
 
               What is that smell, what was that sound, 
               Isn’t that ice on the wings? 
               This is the air, there is the water, 
               But what do you do on the way down? 
               You scream, you scream.
 
How far they must have gone by now,
That old familiar world miles behind,
The man eats an orange,
And now he eats the rind.
He eats his plate, his plastic fork, chews
With animal relish his Styrofoam cup,
Leans over to eat bittersweet Serious too,
Who startles and wakes up.
 
               Look at the desert, look at the green, 
               Is there an end to that ice? 
               Here is a place, and here is a place, 
               But what is the space between? 
               It’s life, it’s life.
 
 
10.
Serious is married.
What a weird wind this is,
He thinks, so still at times,
Then stinging the eyes to tears.
And how he seems both more and less
Himself, and how it seems at once all of loneliness
And something he can hold.
Or is it he who's being carried?
He shivers, and reaches out for her again.
Or is it she who reaches, she who's cold?
What is this wind?
Where are these years?
 
 
11.
Serious experiences loss.
Just like that.
Flat.
Serious experiences loss,
 
As if he’d come to some sheer cliff
There was no way around,
No way to cross,
And found,
On the other side
Of a deep canyon, himself,
Experiencing loss.
 
Serious, when the man is gone,
Tells himself that he tried,
Tells himself that he cried and cried
For all he was worth
To the man sitting on the other side
Experiencing loss,
Who one day simply vanished, or moved on,
Or slipped off the edge of the earth
And died.
 
 
12.
Serious doesn’t speak French.
This embarrasses Serious,
Because insofar as he lives anywhere,
Serious lives in Paris.
 
He feels the city stare,
Feels himself sweat, and shake, as he tries to wrench
The little that he’s gleaned
Into the lot that he desires;
Feels shopkeepers look at him as if he were a liar,
Waiters as if he were unclean;
 
And feels, in truth, not at all serious,
As if he had a huge balloon for a head
And helium squeaks for a voice,
As if gravity could be merely a choice
He were making, and he might instead
Simply stop, let go, and drift away.
 
Finally Serious, opposed to epiphanies,
Has one he can’t resist.
He is Serious, and to be Serious
Is to know something utterly or not at all,
And to know, moreover,
That as you let your half-knowledge fall
From you, it does not exist.
 
Just like that Serious is himself again,
Saying weighty things
About the flowers in the stalls,
Pondering a splendid mirage
Called the Seine.
 
And if he wakes saying fromage,
Or in some shop feels
Right on the verge of translating please,
Serious knows it’s a dream,
And knows from childhood what to do.
Point and scream
Until the damn fools give you cheese.
 
 
13.
Serious has some culture.
He knows some things.
And if, as he begins to speak,
He should feel the immense wings
Of ignorance shadowing him, that dirty vulture
That squawks in drawl and drips tobacco juice,
Serious knows what shelter to seek.
 
Pick a name and Bach is better.
Modernism was powerful but diffuse.
Life’s drained out of pictures since the Renaissance.
Technique! Technique! Technique!
And about all that spastic flatulence
Called contemporary art,
Well, Serious hardly knows where to start.
 
Serious sits through opera without a yawn,
Chews up books on which weaker teeth would shatter;
He can tell you where one brushstroke lies,
List the reasons courtly love is gone,
Pluck the speck of subject matter
From Henry James.
Serious knows some things.
 
He thinks and thinks and thinks
Until his ignorance shrinks
To the tiniest of flies
Alighting somewhere in the Louvre.
Carefully, carefully, Serious creeps
With his massive swatter,
Saying, Don’t move. Don’t move.
 
 
14.
Serious believes in nothing.
It’s a nice day, what should we do?
What are you thinking?
What’s been bothering you?
What’s that you’re drinking?
 
Serious spreads the paper on his lap
To confirm what’s new under the sun,
Hears a tap, tap, tap 
Against the windowpane.
 Nothing ventured, nothing gained,
Floats up from childhood like a bit of ash,
And Serious, pausing, can almost see
His old preacher, that atom bomb of idiocy
Who every Sunday would explode.
Still, Serious thinks, there’s a truth to set you free.
But who could survive the blast?
 Tap, tap, tap.
 
Serious skims the sports pages,
Reads about a storm that rages
Far out at sea.
Some talking dog is taking office,
Some country wiping out monuments, expunging its past.
 Tap, tap, tap.
 Goddammit, Serious says, midway through a war,
And thinks again of that old bore
Who talked and talked and talked
Until you felt your head loll and sway
Like some huge flower on a tiny stalk
That one good breeze would break;
 
And how you’d see him afterwards eating chicken fried steak,
Chicken fried man,
With a tiny transistor radio in his hand
So he could listen to the football game;
And how his face seethed and writhed with what seemed pain
If he saw you coming to his booth,
And he stared off as if some great truth
Were finally, finally coming clear in that chicken fried brain
And like a prophet he was going to stand up and shout—
Until what plopped innocuously out
Was your own name.
 Tap, tap, tap.
 
Serious puts aside the news of the day
And walks to the only window there is.
But there’s no wind, not even the grass stirs.
And anyway, there’s no tree.
Serious shrugs and turns away.
Must just be me.
 
 
13.
Serious sees a child
In the playground across the street,
Sees his huge stupid head and huge stupid feet
As he tries to keep up with the games,
And hears his sonar screams
Of delight amid the other children's screams,
And hears his timid weeping when they call him names.
 
Serious sees the child standing apart sometimes
Driveling to himself in silly rhymes,
And sees him pretend to look intently at the sky
If Serious walks by,
Or sees him simply stop and stare.
 
Gradually Serious starts seeing the child everywhere,
In a store standing in an aisle,
In the subway while
Serious is trying to work on the way home,
Or laughing with his family in a restaurant
Where Serious eats alone.
 
Serious knows the truth.
This child wants something, his whole nature is want.
And it begins to be annoying,
This novice cringing, all the imbecilic and cloying
Tactics of being cute,
The whole hangdog way he has of panhandling pity
With his freckles and his missing tooth,
Sitting all fidgety in his Sunday suit
Or babbling happily as he’s leaking snot;
 
And then the air he suddenly puts on of being serious
When it’s so obvious he’s not.
 
Serious sees the child in the playground
Standing to the side,
Sees his face whiten and his eyes go wide
As Serious crosses the street and strides
Until his shadow swallows the child
And leans down close enough for them to kiss.I don’t have time for this,
Serious says,I’ve got too much to do.
 
And the child says, Who are you?
 
 
16.
Serious kills himself.No, no,
Shivering out of a dream,
Starlight and the hard glitter
Under the bridge’s beam,
Serious, Serious,
Don’t go.
 
Serious crawls out of bed,
Feels the cold in the floor
And thinks, suddenly, of lovely Mad
(Where can she be?)
Who’d bolt out of sleep and screamFarmers get up at four!
It’s three.
 
Serious makes himself a cup of coffee,
Which he doesn’t drink;
Tries and fails to read,
Tries and fails to think.
Serious sits, and holds himself still,
Minute by minute;
Until the dawn finally comes
And he is in it.
 
 
17.
Serious lives alone.
It’s better this way, he tells himself,
As he takes a pan from the pan shelf,
A spatula from the spatula drawer,
And fries two eggs the way he likes them:
Yolks of stone.
 
No more gnats of chatter over breakfast.
No more breakfast. It’s noon.
No one prancing by with only panties on
When he’s almost, almost broken through,
Or singsonging outside his doorSerious, O Serious, where are you?
No more!
 
But what, finally, does Serious do?
He sits, ignores the ringing phone,
Looks at a wall
On one of the last warm days of the year,
And settles back into the lifelong call
Of being serious,
Which is to see, within that whiteness,
Leaves being gently blown,
And to feel their colors as they fall.
 
 
18.
Serious gives a speech.
He sets his papers on the podium,
His glass within easy reach,Tap, tap, taps the microphone.
How vast this venue is.
How absolute this darkness.
 To be serious is to be alone!
Serious cries out with a triumphant look on his face,
Waiting for the echoes to end
Out there in all that space,
Which the words at once define and extend.
It takes a while, but they do die.
The spotlight lasers in.
He blinks hard, starts again.
 To know in every hand another’s touch, To hear a silence words only intensify, To feel not too little but too much This attenuated world—
 
Serious begins to sweat,
Feels the back of his shirt grow wet;
Looks down to see his papers swirled
And scattered, the glass on the floor, broken.
What’s with this fucking light, he thinks,
Or was it spoken?
He glares out at the dark, impassive crowd
And as if by force he could make them wake
Hears his voice growing loud:
 Whatever you most treasure you will break, Whatever you hold closest you will let go, There is no place that you will not leave! But to be serious—
                                  Serious says,
Quietly now, because he has them, they are his—
 To be serious, to be truly serious, is to know That what you call your losses you cannot grieve, For it was never quite these things that you wanted—This treasure, this touch, this one place—But by such life to be haunted.
 
Brilliant!
No notes, no flaws.
Serious stands back and waits for applause.
The hall is silent, utterly silent,
The heat tropic.
 
Serious looks around, confused,
Turns to the man who introduced him
Then can’t remember being introduced;
And even given his credentials,
This suddenly seems a most unlikely topic.
 
Serious tries to get out of the light,
But the light goes where Serious goes.
He blunders to the edge of the stage,
A cliff
Breaking off into a dark
in which there's no movement, no voices, not one sigh.
 
Serious feels the rage
Draining out of him, and feels a chill, and whispers,Where am I?
 
 
19.
Serious nears an end.
It’s cold and getting colder,
And Serious, older,
Sits outside thinking of his good friend,
Who like so much of Serious is gone,
And thinking of that godforsaken dawn
After the one night of his life he spent outdoors.
 Tell me,
His good friend said
When Serious staggered out to the fire,Which form would you say is higher,Tragedy or comedy?
 
And Serious, who had stumbled full-bladdered
In the night from a dream of bears,
Then dreamed himself the object
Of a dozen hungry stares,
Who had swiveled, pissed into the tent,
And sworn such things it would take a life to repent,
Serious, exhausted Serious,
Was silent.
 Because it’s been troubling me,Serious, that the answer can only be tragedy.To be conscious is to be conscious ofLosing whatever it is that you most love,And thus an art that's truly greatWill always have one deepest truth to tell,Which is, my friend, this life is hell.
 
Serious looks at the sky. It’s late.
A small wind blows
The trees, and Serious, shivering, knows
He should head inside,
That he is not well.
But sitting here, letting his eyes close,
Serious can almost see that lake
Aflame with the early sun, and smell
The sweet burn of that wood,
And feel the way it seemed his heart would surely break
Were it not for the strange lightness in his head
As his friend smiled and said,But maybe earth is the heaven of the good.
 
 
20.
Serious talks to God.
There’s no one else left.
His mind is mash,
His world is ash,
And Serious occasionally forgets himself,
Though he is not, not Bereft,
That sniveling idiot two doors down
Who sits up late
With only ashes in the grate
And talks to God.
 See? Serious says. See?Nothing.
Serious spreads his arms magnanimously
As if to give God the floor.
God declines.Thou know’st the first time that we smell the airWe wawl and cry,
Serious says, louder than before.And then we wawl and cry some more,And then we die,And then we rot!
Again he waits in case
There’s disagreement. There’s not.
 
Serious scoffs, goes to brush his teeth,
Forgets briefly to avert his eye
From the mirror’s glare
And finds his father there,
 
That gentle baffled man
Who, when there was no hope,
When he couldn’t even stand,
Carved from a piece of soap
A silly yellow duck
And set it in a little yellow dish.
Serious feels a tingling in his hair
And mutters something close to a prayer,I wish, I wish...
 
The lights go out.Goddammit, Serious shouts
As he trips and falls
To his knees on the floor,
Banging his head on the door
As he tries to rise.GodDAMMIT! Serious cries.
 
The lights come on.
His father’s gone,
But there, at the edge of the sink,
Balances the little duck in the little dish
No serious person would ever keep.
Serious tries to think,
Steadies himself as if at some brink,
Decides he needs sleep,
That’s what he needs,
Crawling fully clothed into his bed
And pulling the covers to his chin
Because, it seems, there’s some strange wind
 
That’s somehow gotten inside.
So unlike Serious,
To leave a door unclosed.
 
Yet here it is, gathering strength
As it blows his books
On the floor and it blows
Right through his body and it blows
Behind and below and above
And out of the whirlwind a voice cries
 
                    Love
 What? Serious says, as he tries
To sit upright and looks
Wildly around him,
Raising his fist in the air.The things...I have lost—
 
Immediately he is tossed
Back against the wall
By the force of a storm
That has no source, no form,
And hears again the call
Out of nowhere:
 
                    Love
 My God! Serious screams,
Unable to help himself,What maundering politician,What decerebrated pop star, What stupid puling poet Couldn’t tell me that? 
Struggling to get out of bed
He starts to cough, then choke,
A riot in his heart,
A riot in his head
As he falls off the edge to the floor.Who do you think you are, 
He gasps. Is this... Is this some sort of JOKE?
 
Suddenly the strange wind is quiet,
But no less strange the calm that comes after.
 I’m serious, the voice says.
 
And Serious dies of laughter.
 
 
EPILOGUE
The dead man’s famous.
No one now remembers him alive,
Or knows his name, or anything he did.
Still, a few stories survive
After all this while
Of a weird-looking man
With a weird-looking smile
That had, it’s said,
Almost a kind of life to it,
Though the man was seriously dead.
 
And some remember how all the flies
Vanished for miles;
And some say no, no, but the buzzards had weird smiles
As if they knew something.
And some tell of an old woman
Who would come and whisper in the dead man’s ear,
And smooth the dead man’s hair,
And if the door opened, disappear.
There are even stories of that grim mortician
Who thought the smile undignified
And tugged and tugged so hard
He slipped and fell inside
Right on top of the dead man,
Whose lips, he swore, seemed to soften,
Seemed to somehow kiss.
And some remember this:
Before the lid was sealed on that coffin
And the nails driven,
There were on that face real tears.
And some say he smiled like a man forgiven.
 
The dead man never hears.
The dead man spins and spins
With his dumb dolphin grin
Through all the places where he is
When people talk of him again:
In classrooms or in planes,
In boredom or in pain;
In front of screens
Or in the spotlight’s glare;
In days too mild to bear
And in the long nights where
The dark grows steep,
The wind wild,
And a mother rises from her sleep
To calm her serious child.

It is not pain that holds me back, but time
With its sad prefigurations and smell,­­­
Its flowers and echoes, rivers and crime.
Even now, without a future, I tell
Myself lies in future tense. As my hair
Thins, I collect combs. When clocks chime, I groan.
The falling world finds pleasure in despair
Because to suffer means to be alone,
And I suffer through all the accidents
Of change as though I were settling a score,
As if to disinvent what death invents.
I once built a castle, now I do chores.
To pass the time I rearrange my things.
To fall asleep I recite names of kings.

Love of air and water
Joined in apprehension,
Perhaps you know what's there
By way of fear, for while
 
Living in pursuit of
And going always forth
Toward something that trembles.
Its knowledge is your mind.
 
What do you think about
The great ocean's sullen
Aristocrats—these small
Headaches and dark affairs
 
That bathe themselves in your
Staging grounds, where you go
To contemplate how what
You want became your mind?
 
The black oblivion
Offers no reprieve for
You, hunter—in its keep
Your ears have grown too sharp,
 
So sharp you almost hear
Your own heartbeat over
The subtle whispers of
Water’s dismal gardens.
 
Everything about you
Is overblown, even
Your mouth is uniquely
Talented at its tasks,
 
Gathering for slaughter
Animals in their sleep,
Speaking without a sound.
Noah had seven laws,
 
You have only one—eat
To build life out of death,
Survive above all things.
The fatalistic moon
 
Filtered down upon you
Seems an imitation
Of lives you will not live.
Would you be its hero?
 
Would you call out against
The morning’s weaving light
That shames the night before
The passing of its cool?
 
Would you be at the beach
When the invisible
Becomes a glow, to surprise?
Inland, workers dreaming
 
Of unitarian
Proposals lose no sleep
To fear about your mouth.
It is their wayward friends,
 
Who wandered too far west
Into fevered chaos,
That wake up with your name
As screams exploding dreams.
 
The inland ether holds
Clouds in your dismal shape.
Lucky are those who know
Nothing, who cannot see
 
Hell outlined in vapor.
Somewhere a piano
Plays a sorrowful song
Half-written by the hate
 
That a grieving loved one
Would stick into your heart.
Such are the arts of men.
Beware. Your time is near.
 
Someone has learned lessons
You didn’t mean to teach.
A crowd is gathering.
Your skull is their kingdom.

Till it emerges, when entourage lobbies for Decalogue,
And hype is the new preparation before its proposal,

Of traditional vulnerability? You'll pace the floor

To the gravity of the insults that have been thrown your way)
Yourself dressed like a clown. Your brain will halt to urbanely sprawl

Why petroleum prices fluctuate with body count and
Meaningful relationships end in kaleidoscopic pain.

For Alma Banda Goddard



my cynical feet ambled
prepared for indigestion
& blank faces of outrageous innocence
knowing I'd have to walk over years of media
declaring we're vanished or savage or pitiful or noble
My toes twitched when I saw so few brown faces
but really when one eats racism every time one goes out one’s door
the appeal of talking about it is minuscule
I sat with my back to the wall facing the door
after I changed the chairs to a circle
This doesn't really protect me
but I con myself into believing it does
One of the first speakers piped upI'm only here because my friend is Black & wantedme to do this with herI've already done300 too many racism workshops
Let it be entered into the Book of Stars
that I did not kill her or shoot a scathing reply from the hip
I let it pass because I could tell she was very interested in taking
up all the space with herself & would do it if I said a word
They all said something that I could turn into a poem
but I got tired & went to sleep behind my interested eyes
I've learned that the most important part of these tortures
is for them to speak about racism at all
Even showing up is heresy
because as we all know racism is some vague thing that really doesn't
exist or is only the skinheads on a bad day or isn't really a crucial problem
not as important certainly as queers being able to marry
or get insurance for each other
When they turned to me as resident expert on the subject
which quite honestly I can't for the life of me understand
or make any sense out of
I spoke from my feet
things I didn't know I knew
of our connections
of the deadly poison that racism is for all of us
Maybe some of them were touched
but my bitch voice jumps in to sayNOT MUCH!
I heard back that someone thought I was brilliant
Does that mean that I speak well
Or that she was changed
It's only her change
I need

ever do is die

My chain breaks as I tempt to kiss the sun,
my knees have a life of their own bending
as if my very existence depended on it,
and it does, for I’d rather be a nut flying high
over people’s heads than on the ground dying
touching the earth, staining the water
with my unclean mind, my hands washing red
off the money so I can sleep off my power trip
and back stabbing toys.
I was an old soul at five spouting off
about the filth of my generation.
I knew greed was the root of all evil,
competition in close cousin.

who taught me well
gave up so much
so their daughters could shine
and they'd swell with pride

in mutual admiration after mass
singing our church songs while making breakfast,
according to the unspoken doctrine in our house of:
fast first eat later after communion,
we intruded with our Mexican music
bellowing out the open windows
the smell of bacon frying,
pancakes baking, coffee
and eggs scrambled to order
it wafted out on beautiful summer mornings
out of our house in Pleasant Hill, Iowa,
perched on the highest spot
one could reach on the East Side of the street

ringing without bells

woodstove of 1960s propaganda
and all the rich hippies knocking poorly at the screen door

of buñuelos and biscochitos and flour on the chin
 
of chokecherry jam dropping out
from the end of a tortilla
 
woodstove
that heard Mentorcito's violin bringing in the new year
 
that saw Tío Eliseo bring in an armload of wood
 
that heard Tío Antonio coming down the road
whistling a corrido and swinging his cane
 
woodstove of the blessed noontime
and Grandma Juanita heating up the caldito
 
woodstove of the sanctified and untamed holy spirit
 
of the dream awake dreamers
prophesizing in the beginning how the end would come
 
of creaking trochil gates left open forever
 
of twisted caved-in gallineros rocking
in weeping April wind
 
of abandoned orchards waist deep
in desánimo
 
of teardrops that held back the laughter
 
of the penitente procession moving through the hills
for the soul of the village
 
woodstove of the wounded faithful proudly
concealing their scars
 
woodstove of armpit farts and bedtime giggles
 
of pitchforks and axes under the bed in case of intruders
 
of coffee cans filled with everything but coffee
 
of ten cents for a cream soda at Corrina's
 
of strawberry Nehis and a bag of chili chips at Medina's
 
of a handful of bubble gum acá Santos's
 
woodstove of genius wisdom dressed up as the village idiot
 
of hand-me-down stories locked away
in the dispensa
 
of bien loco local heroes cracking homeruns
Saturday afternoons en la cañada
 
woodstove
of all that and more of all that disappearing
 
as children played hide 'n' seek in that abandoned goodtime feeling
while stumbling on the footsteps of tradition
 
woodstove that heard the fall of a people rising in silence
 
that died of a loneliness without cure
that cured itself in the company
 
of the so many more lonely

                    The Composing Room
                ","
I still see those men haphazardly standing
around the comps’ floor, mostly silent,
lost in their latest urgent jobs,
looking up and down as if nodding yes
 
from what they call their composers’ sticks
as they set inverse words and lines
of each page that could be taken for
Greek scripture, declaring:
 
In the beginning was the Word and the Word
was made cold type and the Word was
coldness, darkness, shiny greyness
and light—and the Word dwelt amongst us.
 
                                      *
 
Oh, I know these men would laugh this off.
They’d say, if they simply didn’t throw
their eyes to heaven, that they were just ordinary
characters trying to keep the devil from the door,
 
and with luck have enough left over each week
to back a few nags, and go for a few jars.
But they can’t say anything or set anything now.
They are scattered from that place that’s not
 
the same any more and many have left
any place we know of in this life,
calling to mind the old names for printing:The Mysterious Craft or simply The Mystery.
 
                                          *
 
I set them up in another city, another country
that’s as far away in distance
from that city as it’s far in time.
But they are still composing,
 
cracking the odd joke above
their sticks and galleys on some floor
of some building that is eternally busy
inside me even when I’ve forgotten
 
that I’ve forgotten them; forgetting
the world behind the word—
every time I read the word world I wonder
is it a typo and should I delete the l.
 
                                          *
 
Now again I hanker to know the quality
of each letter: the weight, the texture, the smell,
the shiny new type, the ink-dark shades of old,
the different types of type, the various sizes
 
within the same font, the measures in ems,
picas,  points and units. I’d set the words up,
making something out of all this
that stays standing—all set as masterly
 
as the words those men set that reveal
something of the mystery behind
and within these letters and the wonder and
the darkness, but with the lightest touch.
 
                                          *
And the umpteen ways things can foul up
are beyond telling. Maybe the type is off,
or the typesetter may not be up
to the work, if only out of a hangover
 
setting an ! where there should be a ?
or a b where there should be a d,
or miss aspace or a line or dingbat.
And the proofreaders don't catch the error,
 
passing the copy on as clean, or the make-up man
fouls the assembly page, or the stoneman errs
as he fastens the page of cold type and furniture
with the chase, turning the quoin’s key.
 
                                          *
 
Not to speak of the evil eye cast by
fellow composers ready
to knock the words of others, or the bosses
writing on the composition: Kill.
 
Old Shades, keep my words from such eyes
and fretting about that pied world and let me go
on regardless. And even if I foul up and the stewards
are right to set Kill on my last page and my words
 
are distributed and thrown in the hellbox,
the real achievement will be that I tried to set
the words right; that I did it with much labor
and not without a font of love. But that said,
 
                                          *
 
grant me the skill to free the leaden words
from the words I set, undo their awkwardness,
the weight of each letter of each word
so that the words disappear, fall away
 
or are forgotten and what remains is the metal
of feeling and thought behind
and beyond the cast of words
dissolving in their own ink wash.
 
Within this solution we find ourselves,
meeting only here, through The Mystery,
but relieved nonetheless to meet, if only
behind the characters of one fly-boy’s words.

This is my favorite whip
This is a picture of me with a macaw
This is a song I almost could sing.
When I was a freight train
When I was a satellite
When I was a campfire
You should have seen the starburst
You should have tasted my tomato.
I feel sorry for you I’m unqualified
This is my finest tube of toothpaste
This is when I rode like the raj on a yak
This is the gasoline this is the match.

When I was something Rothko forgot
When I was moonlight paving the street
You should have seen the roiling shore
You should have heard the swarm of bees.

Your first dog is ever your one dog
And no story has a happy ending anymore.
We have all wasted lives, sometimes we waste
Our own. Some nights are long ones, some
Never end at all. I don’t know how we canfall in love, which implies landing,
Whereas love promises everything but.
That’s why I like to listen to birds call
At dusk to each other from the acacias
But then I recall it’s still daylight and I
Hear them in the absence of the trees.
When I am traveling by train over mountains
All I think of is the sea. My father was
Never quite so alive until he died and now
He’s immortal. Somebody must do the calculus,
Somebody must work out the logic of the logic
Of this spectacle because spectacle’s the last
Word anyone would use for dreams that don’t cease,
For the sound of weeping coming from the next room,
Only there’s no next room and we’re the only ones
There, though just for a moment and a lifetime more.
Listen, I will tell you a secret, the secret you told
Me once on the train into the mountains
On the journey to the shore, a time long ago when
We spoke and never met. That secret, which is ours.
Some nights are so long the old dog comes home
To us who remain there waiting and waiting
Even if we’ve never been here before, where we are.

If you care about yourself at all, come to your own aid while 
                                   there's still time. 
                               Marcus Aurelius 3.14



Citizen of Rome, you are the center of the universe.
Problem is, circumference is—take a guess—me.
 
“Some things are impatient to be born
While others are impatient to die.” Don’t say
 
I did not warn you. Next time they swear
Shit happens, pop them square in the nose.
 
This will not help anybody, but helping is
The farthest thing from my imperial mind.
 
If you keep your spirit blameless and pure
People will drape you with laurels but
 
No one will have sex with you in backseats
Or marble mausoleums or anywhere else,
 
A small price to pay for honor and respect
Though not for me, being an emperor with no clothes.
 
Just pretend today is the last day of your life
And act accordingly—not that such strictures
 
Apply to Yours Truly, sports fans.
The forces of evil march on the fortress
 
Of your self. I wish I could explain why.
But what if evil did not exist and what if
 
Your self was no fortress, see what I mean?
Stoics get a bad name. Not in touch with feelings.
 Too rigid. Know-it-all cocksure mothers.
So the Stoics retain PR firms, don’t tell a soul.
 
If you really knew what was good for you,
And you do, why do you care I’ll flail you alive?
 
True, pissing off your emperor is a poor plan,
Even one like me mounted bare-assed on a steed.
 
Once upon a time, children…The story peters out.
Circus revels and gladiatorial raves—
 
Seen one, seem them all. Life is tiresome,
When will it end and will we ever notice?
 
I wish I knew. Really, I wish I cared.
My pal, Marcus Aurelius, natters day and night:
 
“Living is more like wrestling than dancing.”
Guess he never saw me take Molly at the club.
 
And he says we always have the option of
Having no opinion. Right. Like he knows.
 
OK, then, where did I put my pants?

We packed your satchel with sweatshirts,
Soccer equipment, and The Elements of Style,
Loaded up the Hum Vee, a sad drive to JFK
And the cross-country flight to starting college,
where fortunately due to Advanced Placement
Courses you’ve already been awarded your MFA
And published your first book.
As we pulled out of the driveway, I slammed
On the brakes, and not on account of Jubilation,
The neighbor’s cat. “Stacey,” I said, “we have jumped the gun.”
“I didn’t know we had a gun, Pops,” you said.
“This is a figure of speech, a melonaphore.
But you can’t go to college yet,
Stacey, you’re barely by my count five years old.”
“That’s all right, Daddy-O, nice try.
But my name’s not Stacey.”

Love this puppy and your love will be repaid.
I can’t stress how little this will teach you about life.
Which it will. Which is a lot.
Sometimes, when you’re sad, I won’t know what to say.
Desire will cut into the bone.
So much we need to cover before you’re on your own.
This is a tea kettle, where goldfish won’t feel at home.
When I was your age, before you were born,
A war was almost certainly about to break out.
The Russians turned out to be just like us,
Only worse drivers, which is a lot like us, too.
I had a pet once, too, you know. An accordion.
Very tough to train, stained with fluids as it was
About which nothing further need be said.
Your questions matter. No, they really do.
I have no clue as to the white carnations,
No reason to suppose the stars were not meant for you.

“Do fish sleep?” I am so glad you asked. Once
Upon a time fish did not even catnap.
Childhood has reached a certain point.
More specific than that, I cannot be,
Or less. When you drive to Chartres
You can see it coming at you far away.
Never pass up a cathedral if you can.
Drink lots of water with the strawberries.
Leap before you look too hard, which makes
Things swim in your head, like fish that never sleep.

“Time’s come to talk to you about the birds.”
“And the bees?”
“What do you know about the bees?”
“Was just asking.”
“A falcon is one bird you can’t keep in a cage,
I can’t explain why, though I might point
To history for many instructive precedents.”
“You have trouble explaining, Dad.”
“Anyway, what I like about birds is, they’re much
Like dreams—they fly in through a window
Where you didn’t know there was a window before.”
“I get it. We open to the known and discover
Mysteries left in their place, like putting under the pillow
A tooth that fell out and you come up with the cash
When you need it in the morning, for school.”
“Let’s stay focussed, Amy.” “Sure, Reginald.”
“I mind it that you call me Reginald, who’s he?”
“Someday, Dad, I may fall in love.”
“Let’s go back to the birds. I don’t want to say
Love is for the ornithologists, though such thoughts occur.
Maybe the real topic is experience.”
“I knew that.” “When?” “You told me.” “I never.”
“Didn’t have to.” “That’s how, you just know?”
“Life’s a vale of tears, Pops, except when it’s not.”
“Hence, sweetheart, some birds thrive in cages.”
“Name three.” “I want you to try on some wings.
I want you to take flight. Like the day I gave birth…”
“What?” “The day I gave birth to you was the day of days.”
“You feeling OK?” “The epidural worked like a charm,
I felt like I was swimming in air.” “I think you’re confused.”
“I wouldn’t be the first, but when they handed you to me
You nursed till you fell asleep.” “You’re talking about love.”
“And some bees sting.”
 
                                              #5 [BOND]
 
Once we had a bond, a sacred trust.
I carried you on my shoulders, we watched
The finches dart and feed, I read The Odyssey 
To you, which OK was a stretch, but who cared
You did not exist? Certainly, not me.
But take the example of Homer.
Would you just give me a chance?
There’s an old dog called Argus
Who waits for the hero to show before he dies.
I’m getting to the point. If we never had a dog
I would wait for you to arrive from a journey
Forced upon you by chance and fate.
You see, the whole thing’s about waiting.
There you are off-stage readying yourself
For a grand entrance into a life none of us
Heretofore presumed. I myself ache
Barometrically in concert with the coming storms.
If you never are, I have something left over
Even if it’s only me, watching you wade in, as if
You were a great swimmer and this world another shore.

                ","
Prologue Willy Loman’s reckless daughter flies quietly,fluttering like a silk-moth behind me
 blocking my life, my scenesin whichever stage direction she wants.
 Sometimes at night I can feel her dialing into me,her ringing calls like an imperial decree.
 When she sleeps she crashes, like a carinto the guardrail of my ambition.
 Her curse like a poison I cannot smell,an asphyxiation of the self by the self, that hell and hard sell.
 Split personalities, we dream through the night,of our merger and acquisition, in her half-moon light,
 Not even my husband can feelher there between us—a secret contract under seal.
 When I awaken, her irises touch mine;an awful, indecipherable fault line.
 She’s a character in search of an author, a devotee,trying to recount her history through me,
 until I channel her. She’s like a phantom limb,hymn to the invisible. Her shameless whims,
 the subtext of my lies. Under her tinted hairthe forest murmurs, becomes a thought, or prayer.
 Until her thoughts tumble into mine;colors bleed. In the morning, I’m overwrought—
 My patrilineal kin, she begins to wear thin,when she undoes hospital corners I’ve tucked so gently in.
 Her cool white rising is meringue completing—the high-pitched silence of our congealing.
 She was always ceremonially unfoldinghis white shirts, unpressing the folds
 in my circumstance. I did and didn’t want her. I kepttrying to catch her, then let her slip. Any intent
 to have her near made her more invisible. Her electricbreasts overfilled my brassieres. An interaction, our dialectic—
 She never removes her hat upon entering the doorto my personality. Ma semblable, ma soeur!

As the father turns away from the thought
of his failure, the hands remove
his glasses and rub his eyes over
 
and over, drying the nonexistent tears.
Unknown to the one who is troubled
about losing his hair, his fingers stroke
 
his baldness as he speaks. The body,
our constant companion, understands
the loneliness of the hostess in her dark
 
driveway, embracing herself after the guests
who promised more and soon have gone,
and even visits the old schoolteacher
 
who reads the same happy ending to each
new class, working her toes in her shoes.
How could the people of the kingdom
 
not have known the curse of sorrow
was nothing more than a long sleep
they had only to wake from? In dreams
 
the body, which longs for transformation
too, suddenly lifts us above the dark
roofs of our houses, and far above
 
the streets of the town, until they seem
like any other small things fastened to earth.

pond in wind,

as a concentrating mind,

Like the poem
 
the pond’s alive—
its beauty (the sudden
scintillation of a hundred
thousand wavelets)
 
and music (the percussion
of a beaver’s tail)
arising from what is.
And when the pond
 
accumulates
the darkness,
which it loves,
it challenges your eyes
 
to find the light
that without darkness
you could not see.

It must be difficult for God, listening
to our voices come up through his floor
of cloud to tell Him what’s been taken away:
Lord, I’ve lost my dog, my period, my hair,
all my money. What can He say, given
we’re so incomplete we can’t stop being
surprised by our condition, while He
is completeness itself? Or is God more
like us, made in His image—shaking His head
because He can’t be expected to keep track
of which voice goes with what name and address,
He being just one God. Either way, we seem
to be left here to discover our losses, everything
from car keys to larger items we can’t search
our pockets for, destined to face them
on our own. Even though the dentist gives us
music to listen to and the assistant looks down
with her lovely smile, it’s still our tooth
he yanks out, leaving a soft spot we ponder
with our tongue for days. Left to ourselves,
we always go over and over what’s missing—
tooth, dog, money, self-control, and even losses
as troubling as the absence the widower can’t stop
reaching for on the other side of his bed a year
later. Then one odd afternoon, watching something
as common as the way light from the window
lingers over a vase on the table, or how the leaves
on his backyard tree change colors all at once
in a quick wind, he begins to feel a lightness,
as if all his loss has led to finding just this.
Only God knows where the feeling came from,
or maybe God’s not some knower off on a cloud,
but there in the eye, which tears up now
at the strangest moments, over the smallest things.

What I’ve come to discuss is mostly about shadows
and the airs left behind in caring, discarding,
the long inhibitions of whereso and when.
Alabaster, a dark quire, in its many pages and premises
the maze, from which move
tendrilled purples and contusions, magnificent
fuchsia receivers of false content,
the splayed flower, arterial, like the premise of a door
is where it leads to or from. Communication
of vessel, vial, capsule, hull, a tiniest nil
fires the neurons from their swooning stall,
is not a healing but adaptation to same
a quickening in deleting of sensation
a prior sizing. Stacked leaves (green shadows)
are givens in the columned garden, what work is needed
to determine that shape? Some hysteric
trope of repetition, rage for accretion,
dazed by its own mute replication,
like the minute lines of a hand. They are
its cries (writes Ponge, among others),
the tongue inseparable from its utterance (langue).
We weep to hear it, a language forgot.
I was saying I keep speaking
from some chamber sound deleted, which is why
I never call or write. In that theatre are many eclipses
and moons refracted in pinholes and wheels
wherein revolve astonished birds, and the Queen of Night
sleeps a rest restorative and profitable, and
andante allegro, the dead ships never sail.

Bridge’s absence gave the creek a new aspect.
Uncrossable, irascible. Crosser stems

The bridge is not an x. It bridges nothing.

Creek’s uncrossability, a new beauty.
“It looked like the process of a thinking,
deep run.” It became the suffering of form

listen to a dream
grandmothers stand
shoulder to shoulder, on the rim of a hill
bend as one, and grasp one thing together
ask them, in the dream world, why
do they cry? they will show you in reply
their shawls of many colours, spread these wings
sweep you in, teach you how
once a year, in the dark of the year we wash
the whole world in a day—for one day, we cry until they're home, until they all are home 
from one dawn to the next mourning
for the broken wailing for regrets
love lost, wrong words, wrong actions
unbalanced moments and all the cracks between heart
and heart, parent and child
lover and beloved friend, nation and nation
creature, and creature of another kind
for what we choose and what we neglect to choose
for what we wish we'd known

lay your hands upon the truth of beauty's loss
heavy, soft as moss, this blanket
full of tears and dust and dying
becomes ocean cradle, healing, dark
the promise, washed clean by our sorrow
today crying out, as we're birthing tomorrow
not so much redemption
as the law of moon and season
calls for justice
one day, the lawmakers must
exit their echoing halls, fall in
with the grandmothers dancing
carry it                 cry it clean until they're home, until they are all home 
until light through their bodies
translates to rainbows hung over the land
until light through their bodies
translates to rainbows strung over this land
until light through our bodies
translates to rainbows shining over our land until we're home, until we all are home

and forgets us,
as it has forgotten
all those
who’ve opened these waters:
fisherman, monk, pilgrim and pagan,
some foundering here.
Our mainland
world diminishes.
There is respite.
A cloud engulfs us
out of nowhere

rising like chapel and cathedral.

We forget speech, hypnotized by the climb,
concentrating on narrow, rock-hewn steps
that spiral up like the gyres
of the Book of Kells, whirling in labyrinths
of knowledge, turmoil and eternity.
They lead to the beehive huts and oratories
packed with a congregation of sightseers
who whisper in disbelief and reverence
at how those sometime monks lived
in this wind-tugged cloister of shells.
 
We browse in each dome’s live absence
and picnic above the graveyard
that’s no bigger than a currach
with a crucifix for helmsman
navigating his crew to the island of the dead.
We’re eyed by the staunch, monkish puffins.
Our tongues loosen, but, in keeping
with the somberness of this sun-haloed place,
we chat about the world with an earnestness
that would embarrass us on the mainland.
 
You tell of medieval monks charting world maps
with countries drawn as humans gorging upon
each other’s entangled bodies. We go on to
the lands and demons of the world of poetry.
I’m flummoxed when you ask what poetry is.
I recall how the earliest musical instruments
were hewn out of bones, and that poets
carve their words out of those gone before.
They are the primitive musicians who beat
and blow words back to life. More than that I don’t know.

That dusk at Dún an Óir we slaughtered even
the pregnant, whimpering women methodically
while a bloodstained sun drowned in the ocean.
Each fetus struggled in the belly
of each slain mother as desperately
as a lobster dropped in a boiling pot.
Had shed blood been ink, I could still be
quilling The Faerie Queene, but I did not
allow a drop to blot a mere sonnet
that you, trapped in complicity, can never
quite break free of. Admit it, hypocrite!
In your time few are not guilty of slaughter.
Even the page you’ll pen this upon is of pine
that Amazonians were shot for. I could go on.

always wary that around the next bend
   my life would catch up with me.
My rakish ways squandered energy

more worthy of the muse-gift given to me

already becoming Cork mud.

rouse to my touch.

I sang not for my own or for beauty's sake
as much as to keep our spirits fired, 
knowing as long as we sang we'd not break, 
refusing to allow the country be shired.
But it was too much when even our lands
turned hostile and drove us like lapwings
in the hard winter, together in dying bands,
our swollen bellies pregnant with nothing. 
Even the birds seemed to give up singing. 
So I lay down and relinquished song.

The islands' standing army
of gannets fiercely snap,
stab and peck one another.
Few could match
the spite I unleashed 
on any who encroached 
into my territory. I spat 
with petrel accuracy. 
I should have had the wisdom 
of the sad-eyed puffins 
who let everyone come close,
sensing few mean hurt, 
though when forced to tussle
they'll show their worth. 
So learn from me. 
When I come to mind
don't recall how, feisty, 
I knocked nests of words
over the edge,
splattering on the rocks

ravaging, wing-elbowing birds; 
rather think of the winged poems 
I hatched, seen, 
regardless of time and place, 
gliding and gyring

has a preternatural quality 
as it flutters about
my head, drawing me
from sleep's underworld. 
I resist its pull. 
Everything turns
into dream's usual montage. 
Another figure emerges 
but says nothing, 
as if that's what he came to say. 
His face merges into
one of a gagged female. 
She shimmers and vanishes. 
Dolphins break
beyond Blind Man's Cove,
returning the dead
to Bull Island, transmitting
their encrypted, underwater Morse. 
The savant local ferryman
informs us that Skellig Michael
was once a druidic site. 
His oil-wrinkled hands tug
the engine cord,
coaxing our boat
out of the cliff-shaded cove.
We withdraw
into the distance, 
leaving a disgruntling sense
that we've only touched the tip
of these dark icebergs.

(for Niyi Osundare)



Something in altitude kindles power-thirst
Mere horse-height suffices the emir
Bestowing from rich folds of prodigious turban
Upon crawling peasants in the dust
Rare imperceptible nods enwrapped
In princely boredom.
 
I too have known
A parching of that primordial palate,
A quickening to manifest life
Of a long recessive appetite.
Though strapped and manacled
That day I commanded from the pinnacle
Of a three-tiered world a bridge befitting
The proud deranged deity I had become.
A magic rug of rushing clouds
Billowed and rubbed its white softness
Like practiced houri fingers on my sole
And through filters of its gauzy fabric
Revealed wonders of a metropolis
Magic-struck to fairyland proportions.
By different adjustments of vision
I caused the clouds to float
Over a stilled landscape, over towers
And masts and smoke-plumed chimneys;
Or turned the very earth, unleashed
From itself, a roaming fugitive
Beneath a constant sky. Then came
A sudden brightness over the world,
A rare winter’s smile it was, and printed
On my cloud carpet a black cross
Set in an orb of rainbows. To which
Splendid nativity came–who else would come
But gray unsporting Reason, faithless
Pedant offering a bald refractory annunciation?
But oh what beauty! What speed!
A chariot of night in panic flight
From Our Royal Proclamation of the rites
Of day! And riding out Our procession
Of fantasy We slaked an ancient
Vestigial greed shriveled by ages of dormancy
Till the eyes exhausted by glorious pageantries
Returned to rest on that puny
Legend of the life jacket stowed away
Of all places under my seat.
 
Now I think I know why gods
Are so partial to heights—to mountain
Tops and spires, to proud iroko trees
And thorn-guarded holy bombax,
Why petty household divinities
Will sooner perch on a rude board
Strung precariously from brittle rafters
Of a thatched roof than sit squarely
On safe earth.

''At one time, I dreaded everything I was making.' 
Yayoi Kusama (Winter 1999)



First it is just a measling of the tablecloth
but soon it spills
in all colours, all gaiety:
                           desk        floor        lamp        flowers
          tatami, my underwear
 
then dares to paw across
         Mother’s face, so
smilingdelirious.
 
Twenty years
in a twelve square metre room
with the thuds of tennis balls
the only music
 
tells me
that suffering
is necessary
 
and more powerful
than healing
 
and I wish
to cover all territory
for once—hospital beds, chinaware,
bed linen, your bland skin
 
with the pattern and fear of all my dots—
by the old wharf on Naoshima
I make my yellow wartime pumpkins.
 
I know my home is not a country anymore,
just a festering colony of the mind:
 
these shuddering trees
that come and talk to me each night,
the whispers of the white nurses
and the star-dances
of my Japanese kaleidoscope.
Come haunt me still. Do what you may.
I won’t return. I’m not afraid.

Finding myself in a mesmeric orientation,
before me appeared Benjamin Franklin,
who magnetized his French paramours
at dinner parties as an amusing diversion
from his most serious studies of electricity
and the ethereal fire. I like thinking about
how he would have stood on tiptoe to kiss
their buzzing lips and everyone would gasp
and clap for the blue spark between them.
I believe in an honest and forthright manner,
a democracy of plain speech, so I have to
find a way to explain I don’t care to have sex
anymore. Once I was a high school teacher
and there was a boy who everyday came in late,
who only came to school at all to sell drugs
out of his backpack, upon which he laid
his head like a pillow and closed his eyes
while I pointed at a chart diagramming
the anatomy of a sparrow. The vice principal
was watching and taking notes as I taught
this class, so I slid the bag from under
his cheek, as if not to wake him, wrapped
his fingers around a pen. I was trying
to be a gentle mother and also trying
to show I was in control of an unstable
situation. The boy, also trying to be
in control of himself, walked so slow
to my desk and we stood to watch him
push everything—binders, piles of ungraded
papers, a beaker of red pens to the floor.
He was so calm. How do you like it when I touch your things. I do not like it. I live
in a house with many blue mason jars,
each containing a feather collection or starfish
collection or vertebrae collection, and also
there is a fully articulated fetal alligator skeleton.
Each window is pressed by the design
of a sweet-gum branch, all the little orange
and red stars of its leaves, you can’t see
the perfect geometry this close, just haphazard
parabolas, but beneath the foundation
the roots mirror the branching. I have
a chart of this to pull down. The view is flat
and so quiet on the inside. Have I been
forthright yet? What I want to know is
what happens if I decide to never have sex
again? Or more precisely, can I decide
to not have sex again and still be kind?
And be a joy to others? I should mention
I am a wife. I should mention I was told
my sole purpose is to be joy to others.
The sidewalks outside are very full of people
and when I look at them I feel hopeless.
Benjamin Franklin was so jolly with his kite
and his key and his scandalous electricity.
He was so in love with women and drink
and democracy. Before I was this way,
I was not a house, I was just a jar and what
I wanted was to be broken. A cool trick
you can do that I once showed a class is crank
a wheel covered in felt against another felt
wheel. Static bristles and sparks and makes
your hair stand on end. But hook it to
a Leyden jar and the electricity fills up
in there, invisible as air. Becomes a glass
battery, until you too much the thing, then
wow! broken glass everywhere. I remember
wanting that. Do I have to always want that?
My house is blue and quiet. I can hardly
hear the squirrel in my sweet-gum tree
dancing like a sunbeam to sing his riddles:
“A house full, a hole full, but you cannot
gather a bowl full.” The air of everywhere
is wet with electric fluid, you can’t even tell,
but pop, whiz, everywhere. “In this
field,” Ben says, “the soul has room
enough to expand, to display all of her
extravagances.” The sweet gum has 10,000
sticky, spiky seed balls. They start green
but grow black and fall for want of
a barren season. They look like sea urchins.
I call them tree urchins and think it’s
a funny joke. I don’t tell it to anyone,
as I am tired of being told what is not.
Such a secret, I know, is an extravagance,
and I like best how it’s an extravagance so
small you must keep it in a jar with others
of its kind for it to ever mean anything at all.

My child is sitting cross-legged on the floor reading to herself.
Sometimes she is so full of need I push her to the floor.
Only once I did that and I don’t even remember the moment
right, but I was trying to wipe urine off my leg and she was
naughty like a squirrel and jumping and singing and her head
slammed into my chin, which hurt and even more than that,
it pissed me off, because she’s my beautiful child, but in that
button snap of a moment she was suddenly just one more person
and I pushed her away in a way that felt to me like setting her
down, but awkwardly, because of how she was also balancing
her feet on my feet as I tried to pour out a bowl of pee
from her little potty as a toothbrush dangled foaming
from my mouth. Somewhere in the mess of that morning
she’d become person enough to, in the space between us,
create force of momentum, and then I did not set her down,
but pushed her and she fell away from it against the wall
and was crying because I, her mommy, pushed her. And I know
this should be the poem about how I’m horrified at myself,
the poem about what in ourselves we have to live with,
but in that moment which followed two years of breastfeeding
and baby-wearing and sixty-nine hours of natural childbirth
and the hemorrhaging and the uncertain operation, after which
I pumped every two hours, careful not to let the cord tangle
in the IV. Even then when she cried and no matter what
and no matter and no matter and no matter and no matter what,
I held her all night if she cried so she would not ever know
someday you’ll cry alone, but I held her and ached and leaked
and bled too as long as it took. Of course there’ve been nights
since but sometimes it feels as if I’ve never been asleep again,
so when I say I pushed my two-year-old against a wall and I don’t
remember it happening that way but it happened and I did
and I’ve been wondering a long time now what the limit is
and when I would find the end of myself, and that day, which
was yesterday, was the end. And this day, when we played
hide-and-seek with Daddy, and touched bugs, and readFrog and Toad Are Friends twice together before she read it
to herself as I wrote this, this is the day that comes after.

The woman at the Salvation Army who sorts and prices is in her eighties

She glances up from her pricing and says something about the tea set
and a baby doll long ago.
 
I am careful not to make eye contact, but the mother with drapes has
such softness in her shoulders and her face and she knows how to say
the perfect kind thing—“What a wonderful mother you had.”
 
“Yes, she was.”
 
Why do children sometimes notice us and sometimes not?
 
From the bin of dolls: “What happened to your mother?”
 
“She died.”
 
The woman at the Salvation Army who sorts and prices is crying a little.
She seems surprised to be crying. “It’s been eighty years and I still miss
her.”
 
When my daughter was born I couldn’t stop thinking about how we
were going to die. If we were drowning, would it be better to hold her
to me even as she fought away or should I let her float off to wonder why
her mother didn’t help her? What if it’s fire and I have one bullet left? I
made sure my husband knew if there were death squads and he had to
choose, I’d never love him again if he didn’t choose her. If I’m lucky,
her crying face is the last thing I’ll see.
 
The mother with drapes is squeezing her daughter’s shoulder, trying to
send a silent message, but children are children. “Why did she die?”
 
“She was going to have a baby and—And she died.”
 
“But she was a wonderful mother.”
 
I’m holding a stack of four wooden jigsaw puzzles of farm animals,
dinosaurs, jungle animals, and pets. Each for a quarter.
 
“It’s silly how much I still miss her.” She takes out a tissue and wipes

For James Welch



The first harvest of wheat in flatlands
along the Milk startled me into thoughts of you
and this place we both remember and also forget as home.
Maybe it was the familiarity or maybe it was my own
need to ask if you have ever regretted leaving.
What bends, what gives?
And have you ever missed this wind?—it has now
grown warm with late summer, but soon
it will be as dangerous as the bobcat stalking calves
and pets just south of the river.
Men take out their dogs, a case of beer and wait
in their pickups for dawn, for a chance with their rifles.
They don’t understand that she isn’t going to make
any mistakes. With winter my need for an answer
grows more desperate and there are only four roads out.  
One is the same cat hunters drive with mannish glory
and return along, gun still oil-shined and unshot.
Another goes deeper into Assiniboine territory:
This is the one I should talk myself into taking next.
I haven’t much traveled the third except to visit
a hospital where, after the first time,
my mother had refused chemotherapy.
And the last road you know as well as I do—
past the coral-painted Catholic church, its doors
long ago sealed shut to the mouth of Mission Canyon,
then south just a ways, to where the Rockies cut open 
and forgive. There you and I are on the ascent.
After that, the arrival is what matters most.

When black, men drown. They spend their whole lifetimes
justifying the gall of springing the trap, the inconvenience
of slouched denim, of coupling beyond romance or aim.
All the while, the rising murk edges toward their chins.
Hurriedly, someone crafts another scientific tome, a giddy
exploration of the curious dysfunction identifying black
men first as possible, then as necessary. Elegant equations
succumb to a river that blurs quotient and theory, rendering
them unreadable, and the overwhelm easily disappears
the men, their wiry heads glistening, then gulped. All that’s
left is the fathers’ last wisdom, soaked wreckage on silver:Girl, that water ain’t nothing but wet. I’m gon’ be alright.
 
When black men drown, their daughters turn to their mothers
and ask What should I do with this misnamed shiver in myleft shoulder? How should I dress in public? They are weary
of standing at the shore, hands shading their eyes, trying
to make out their own fathers among the thousands bobbing
in the current. The mothers mumble and point to any flailing
that seems familiar. Mostly, they’re wrong. Buoyed by church
moans and comfort food of meat and cream, the daughters
try on other names that sound oddly broken when pressed
against the dank syllables of the fathers’. Drained, with justforward in mind, they walk using the hip of only one parent.
They scratch in their sleep. Black water wells up in the wound.
 
When black men drown, their daughters are fascinated with
the politics of water, how gorgeously a surface breaks
to receive, how it weeps so sanely shut. And the thrashing
of hands, shrieking of names: I was Otis, I was Willie Earl,they called me Catfish. Obsessed by the waltzing of tides,
the daughters remember their fathers—the scorch of beard
electrifying the once-in-a-while kiss, the welts in thick arms,
eyes wearied with so many of the same days wedged behind
them. When black men drown, their daughters memorize all
the steps involved in the deluge. They know how long it takes
for a weakened man to dissolve. A muted light, in the shape
of a little girl, used to be enough to light a daddy’s way home.
 
When black men drown, their daughters drag the water’s floor
with rotting nets, pull in whatever still breathes. They insist their
still-dripping daddies sit down for cups of insanely sweetened
tea, sniffs of rotgut, tangled dinners based on improbable swine.
The girls hope to reacquaint their drowned fathers with the concept
of body, but outlines slosh in drift and retreat. The men can’t get
dry. Parched, they scrub flooded hollows and weep for water
to give them name and measure as mere blood once did. Knocking
over those spindly-legged dinette chairs, they interrupt the failed
feast and mutter Baby girl, gotta go, baby gotta go, their eyes
misted with their own murders. Grabbing their girls, they spit
out love in reverse and stumble toward the banks of some river.
 
When black men drown their daughters, the rash act is the only
plausible response to the brain’s tenacious mouth and its dare: Yes, yes, open your ashed hands and release that wingless child. Note
the arc of the sun-drenched nosedive, the first syllable of the child’s
name unwilling from the man’s mouth, the melody of billow that
begins as blessed clutch. Someone crouching inside the father waits
impatiently for the shutting, the lethargic envelop, and wonders if
the daughter’s wide and realizing eye will ever close to loose him.
It never will, and the man and his child and the daughter and her
father gaze calmly into the wrecked science of each other’s lives.
The sun struggles to spit a perfect gold upon the quieting splash.
The river pulses stylish circles of its filth around the swallow.

It seems insane now, but
she’d be standing soaked
in schoolday morning light,
her loose-leaf notebook,
flickering at the bus stop,
and we almost trembled
 
at the thought of her mouth
filled for a moment with both
of our short names. I don’t know
what we saw when we saw
her face, but at fifteen there’s
so much left to believe in,
 
that a girl with sunset
in her eyes, with a kind smile,
and a bright blue miniskirt softly
shading her bare thighs     really
could be The Goddess. Even
the gloss on her lips sighedKiss me    and you’ll never
 do homework again. Some Saturdays
my ace, Terry, would say, “Guess
who was buying Teaberry gum
in the drugstore on Stenton?”
And I could see the sweet
epiphany still stunning his eyes
 
and I knew that he knew
that I knew he knew     I knew—
especially once summer had come,
and the sun stayed up till we had
nothing else to do but wish
and wonder about fine sistas
 
in flimsy culottes and those hotpants! 
James Brown screamed about: Crystal
Berry, Diane Ramsey, Kim Graves,
and her. This was around 1970: Vietnam
to the left of us, Black Muslims
to the right, big afros all over my
 
Philadelphia. We had no idea
where we were, how much history
had come before us—how much
cruelty, how much more dying
was on the way. For me and Terry,
it was a time when everything said
 maybe, and maybe being blinded
by the beauty of a tenth grader
was proof that, for a little while,
we were safe from the teeth
that keep chewing up the world.
I’d like to commend
 
my parents    for keeping calm,
for not quitting their jobs or grabbing
guns    and for never letting up
about the amazing “so many doors
open to good students.” I wish
 
I had kissed
Delores Jepps. I wish I could
have some small memory of her
warm and spicy mouth to wrap
these hungry words around. I
 
would like to have danced with her,
to have slow-cooked to a slow song
in her sleek, toffee arms: her body
balanced between the Temptations’ 
five voices and me—a boy anointed
 
with puberty, a kid with a B
average and a cool best friend.
I don’t think I’ve ever understood
how lonely I am, but I was
 
closer to it at fifteen because
I didn’t know anything: my heart
so near the surface of my skin
 
I could have moved it with my hand.

I remember that first time:
the empty auditorium, her voice,
the dark all around us,
her mouth reaching into mine.
She was Freddy’s foxy older sister,
and I didn’t know why
she wanted to kiss me. She
had already finished high school
and probably shouldn’t have
been walking the halls, but
she always called me her friend.
So one Monday after gym,
 
I found myself beside myself
in front of her house—with my
trench coat and lunch bag—
probably not looking much
like Shaft. Inside, the air held
warm milk and we talked a bit
about her baby    and her Aunt
who paid the rent painting cars.
 
Maybe she liked me because
we were both black and mostly
alone in the suburbs, but I hadn’t
thought about that. It was her voice
that got me—banked fire, the color
of dusk—her voice, and my name
was smoke in her mouth.
 
I think about it more than I should now,
that January noon—an hour before
algebra—how most days I’d be
thinking football    or replaying
the seventy-some kisses I’d gotten
over those lean years, but that day
 
Donna and me were on the couch
munching potato chips. Rrruffles have rrridges, she kidded coming
from checking the baby who’d
slipped into a nap. I was kind of
disappointed that we hadn’t
done anything, but I needed time
to get back to school, so I started
to stand. She said wait, look at this mess,
 
and with her left hand, she
brushed the crumbs from my lap
the way you’d whisk away lint—
then, swept over my pants again—
to be thorough, I guessed, but slower
and then some more, as if her hand
 
were getting    drowsy. You know
how sometimes you see something
but just can’t believe it—like a squirrel
bobbling a biscuit on your kitchen counter
or a cricket creeping the red feathers
of your mother’s Sunday hat?
 
Her hand there, on my lap,
could easily have been a five-fingered
flying saucer from the fifth dimension.
For awhile, I just watched and
wondered if she knew where
her hand had landed    but it was me
who didn’t know: me with my
six dozen kisses and the great Eden
of my virginity. How
do we not talk about it
 
every day: the ways
we were changed
by the gift
in someone’s touch—your body,
suddenly a bright instrument
played by an otherwise
silent divinity.
 
When I heard my zipper, I couldn’t
have said where my arms
were    or what a clock was for:
I had
no idea    I could be such a stranger
and still be myself. How could I
have known what a girl
 
might do to a boy
with her mouth     if she felt
like doing what her mouth
could do? It was
a kind of miracle: the dreamedimpossible—my soul finally called
to my flesh. I didn’t know
what I didn’t know    and then I knew.

him long in those last moments
before allowing him to walk out
her door, meander through snowy
 
grooves, finding his way home
while she looked out windows
where ice crystals gathered
on the proper side of the pane
 
holding her breath as long as she
dared, letting his presence seep
out only when she could no longer
bear, leaving him to be a vapor ghost
 
on her window, a fog sure
to vanish even before she turned
from the window and here I am
years later living in that same

The unsympathetic wind, how she has evaded me for years now,
leaving a guileless shell and no way to navigate. Once when I stood
on a plateau of earth just at the moment before the dangerous,
jutting peaks converged upon the lilting sway of grasslands, I almost
found a way back. There, the sky, quite possibly all the elements,
caused the rock and soil and vegetation to congregate. Their prayer
was not new and so faint I could hardly discern. Simple remembrances,
like a tiny, syncopated chorus calling everyone home: across
a thousand eastward miles, and what little wind was left at my back.
But I could not move. And then the music was gone.
All that was left were the spring time faces of mountains, gazing down,
their last patches of snow, luminous. I dreamed of becoming snow melt,
gliding down the slope and in to the valley. With the promise,
an assurance, that there is always a way to become bird, tree, water again.

                ","
Some lunatic with a gun killed some people at an
immigration center in Binghamton, New York. Liz
Rosenberg and her family live up there and David, her
husband, teaches in the middle school which is close to
all the action (the way, in any smallish town, everything is
close to all the action). I called Liz to see if everyone was
all right and she was in her car driving to the elementary
school to pick up Lily, her young daughter she brought
back from China a few years ago. Lily was fine, but
Liz wanted to move her outside the question of how to
make sense of the broken pieces of “someone” with a
gun walking into a public space and then firing. There’s
something called (I learned from a news report the day of
the shootings at Virginia Tech) The Talking Day which
refers to the day immediately following the day when
something wildly violent happens. No one quite grasps
the reality of the situation and everyone spends that first day
talking about what happened and reliving it as language—
not so much to understand the violence but to make a
kind of recording of it: talking about it, letting go of it,
putting it down. And so I imagine it must be with Liz and
Lily and David in Binghamton, New York today: letting
“something” go. Liz is in her car after having just picked up
Lily at school and driving back home through a town that
suddenly makes no sense and she is telling the story about
what happened when a young man walked into a building
with a gun. And for Lily, who’s had a pretty serene, un-
violent United States time so far and whose endless joy
has made her an adorable chatterbox, tomorrow could be
her first talking day. Or, if not tomorrow, some other day.
We live in a talking day world.

The radio clicks on—it’s poor swollen America,
Up already and busy selling the exhausting obligation
Of happiness while intermittently debating whether or not
A man who kills fifty people in five minutes
With an automatic weapon he has bought for the purpose
Is mentally ill. Or a terrorist. Or if terrorists
Are mentally ill. Because if killing large numbers of people
With sophisticated weapons is a sign of sickness—
You might want to begin with fire, our early ancestors
Drawn to the warmth of it—from lightning,
Must have been, the great booming flashes of it
From the sky, the tree shriveled and sizzling,
Must have been, an awful power, the odor
Of ozone a god’s breath; or grass fires,
The wind whipping them, the animals stampeding,
Furious, driving hard on their haunches from the terror
Of it, so that to fashion some campfire of burning wood,
Old logs, must have felt like feeding on the crumbs
Of the god’s power and they would tell the story
Of Prometheus the thief, and the eagle that feasted
On his liver, told it around a campfire, must have been,
And then—centuries, millennia—some tribe
Of meticulous gatherers, some medicine woman,
Or craftsman of metal discovered some sands that,
Tossed into the fire, burned blue or flared green,
So simple the children could do it, must have been,
Or some soft stone rubbed to a powder that tossed
Into the fire gave off a white phosphorescent glow.
The word for chemistry from a Greek—some say Arabic—
Stem associated with metal work. But it was in China
Two thousand years ago that fireworks were invented—
Fire and mineral in a confined space to produce power—
They knew already about the power of fire and water
And the power of steam: 100 BC, Julius Caesar’s day.
In Alexandria, a Greek mathematician produced
A steam-powered turbine engine. Contain, explode.

100,000, in more terrifying fashion in the firebombing
Of Tokyo. Two arms races after the ashes settled.
The other industrial countries couldn’t get there
Fast enough. Contain, burn. One scramble was
For the rocket that delivers the explosion that burns humans
By the tens of thousands and poisons the earth in the process.
They were wondering if the terrorist was crazy. If he was
A terrorist, maybe he was just unhappy. The other
Challenge afterwards was how to construct machine guns
A man or a boy could carry: lightweight, compact, easy to
     assemble.
First a Russian sergeant, a Kalashnikov, clever with guns
Built one on a German model. Now the heavy machine gun.
The weapon of European imperialism through which
A few men trained in gunnery could slaughter native armies
In Africa and India and the mountains of Afghanistan,
Became “a portable weapon a child can operate.”
The equalizer. So the undergunned Vietnamese insurgents
Fought off the greatest army in the world. So the Afghans
Fought off the Soviet army using Kalashnikovs the CIA
Provided to them. They were throwing powders in the fire
And dancing. Children’s armies in Africa toting AK-47s
That fire thirty rounds a minute. A round is a bullet.

100 million of them are Kalashnikov-style semi-automatics.

They were mostly young men, they were dancing in a club,
A spring night. The radio clicks on. Green fire. Blue fire.
The immense flocks of terrified birds still rising
In wave after wave above the waters in the dream time.
Crying out sharply. As the French ship breasted the vast

Of the new land. America. A radio clicks on. The Arabs,

The age of portrait is drugged. Beauty

there was to be no untimely exposure of donors,

tossed mega livers and mammoth hearts

of her death? Nothing memorable,
frail old age. But the colonel on table nineteen
with an accessory spleen had put a bullet through
his temple, a final prayer. Not in entry or exit

A mother possum crawled down the chimney

the same April after your dad and I divorced
when you kicked a hole in the dining room wall.
The possum was swollen with young

“An oversized rat with maternal instincts,”
your dad once said.
 
Instead of one angry son, I now had two–
fifteen and seventeen–
two forged signatures on absence excuses,
two discipline committee meetings,
two conferences with the principal.
While I worked,
you shared contraband beer,
as well as the basement bedroom
with its fieldstone fireplace
in which you found the possum one cool evening.
 
Laughing and cheering, you teamed up
to cage her with a trash can,
carry her to the alley out back and dump her.
The possum squeezed back
down the chimney twice more. The third time
you threw her out on Troost Avenue, screaming
for a car to smash her beneath its tires.
She must have been near her time,
desperate for a nest,
to crawl back down after that.
The noise woke me after midnight.
Donny had clubbed her with his nunchuks.
You both kicked and stomped
her head as she lurched, stumbled
between your feet.
Halfway down

seeing your faces. The possum fell
limp. I backed slowly up the stairs.

as glass lies broken by my feet

dripping from carcasses of dreams:
Where despair
is old people
sitting on torn patio sofas

temples desolated by a people’s rage.

recall good times,
drink and welcome daylight

where teachers threw me
from classroom to classroom,
not knowing where I could fit in.

jumped over fences,

factory walls.

bleeding from
broken limbs and torn flesh,
and where years later
we shot up carga

All night vigil.
My two-and-a-half-year-old boy
and his 10-month-old sister
lay on the same bed,
facing opposite ends;
their feet touching.
They looked soft, peaceful,
bundled there in strands of blankets.
I brushed away roaches that meandered
across their faces,
but not even that could wake them.
Outside, the dark cover of night tore
as daybreak bloomed like a rose
on a stem of thorns.
I sat down on the backsteps,
gazing across the yellowed yard.
A 1954 Chevy Bel-Air stared back.
It was my favorite possession.
I hated it just then.
It didn’t start when I tried to get it going
earlier that night. It had a bad solenoid.
I held a 12-gauge shotgun across my lap.
I expected trouble from the Paragons gang
of the west Lynwood barrio.
Somebody said I dove the car
that dudes from Colonia Watts used
to shoot up the Paragons’ neighborhood.
But I got more than trouble that night.
My wife had left around 10 p.m.
to take a friend of mine home.
She didn’t come back.
I wanted to kill somebody.
At moments, it had nothing to do
with the Paragons.
It had to do with a woman I loved.
But who to kill? Not her–
sweet allure wrapped in a black skirt.
I’d kill myself first.
Kill me first?
But she was the one who quit!
Kill her? No, think man! I was hurt, angry. . .
but to kill her? To kill a Paragon?
To kill anybody?
I went into the house
and put the gun away.
 
Later that morning, my wife came for her things:
some clothes, the babies. . . their toys.
A radio, broken TV, and some dishes remained.
I didn’t stop her.
There was nothing to say that my face
didn’t explain already.
Nothing to do. . . but run.
 
So I drove the long haul to Downey
and parked near an enclosed area
alongside the Los Angeles River.
I got out of the car,
climbed over the fence
and stumbled down the slopes.
A small line of water rippled in the middle.
On rainy days this place flooded and flowed,
but most of the time it was dry
with dumped garbage and dismembered furniture.
Since a child, the river and its veins of canals
were places for me to think. Places to heal.
Once on the river’s bed, I began to cleanse.
I ran.
 
I ran into the mist of morning,
carrying the heat of emotion
through the sun’s rays;
I ran past the factories
that lay smack in the middle
of somebody’s backyard.
I ran past alleys with overturned trashcans
and mounds of tires.
Debris lay underfoot. Overgrown weeds
scraped my legs as I streamed past;
recalling the song of bullets
that whirred in the wind.
 
I ran across bridges, beneath overhead passes,
and then back alongside the infested walls
of the concrete river;
splashing rainwater as I threaded,
my heels colliding against the pavement.
So much energy propelled my legs
and, just like the river,
it went on for miles.
 
When all was gone,
the concrete river
was always there
and me, always running.

                ","
When Heavy tells a story
the millwright shanty under the electric furnaces
chokes with quiet, amid the roar,
as Heavy pauses, adjusts his mountainous weight
over a creaky grease-stained metal chair
and looks up at the whirling ceiling fan
next to fluorescent lights hanging by wires.
His fingers lace like so many sausages
across the canvas of blue workshirt
on his chest.
 
Heavy tells his story
and the voice of reason quickens the demise
of foulness from red-faced millwrights
just back from a repair job
and sitting around for the five air whistles
that again call them to combat on the furnace floor.
 
All laughter stops, all nonsense sayings
and cuts of wisdom cease their echo
when Heavy tells a story.
 
Heavy talks about the Mexican melter
who once had an affair with the Pit Boss’s wife.
The heart of the problem–and the fact
from which the story’s plot revolves–
was that the melter lived across the street
from the Pit Boss.
One night just before the graveyard shift,
the melter left his home, kissed his wife’s
round face and proceeded to walk to the bus stop.
But a bullet pierced through his hardhat
and he fell, like an overturned stack of fire bricks,
onto the pavement.
The moral of this story:
Never have an affair with someone
whose old man lives
within shooting distance.
 
Heavy tells a story
about a furnace foreman who always yelled
at the laborers for failing to clean
the bag house of the built-up filth
from hours of cooking scrap iron and ore.
The men told him it was too dangerous
to walk on the tin-roofed panels;
their weight could cause
them to fall some 30 feet
into the gaping mouth of a flaming furnace below.
“Nonsense,” the foreman yelled,
“you’re all just lazy Polacks.”
(he called everyone Polacks).
The foreman then proceeded to walk
across the roof as the men stood nearby,
with mouths open, near the safety of side beams.
“You see,” he said standing in the middle
as hydraulics moved shutters
up and down to capture the sulphur dust.
 
Then the foreman moved forward
and before anyone could shout,
he crashed through the roof,
screaming into a reddened pot of molten metal;
the oxygen in his body making popping sounds
as it entered. The furnace operates continued
to pour ladles of scrap iron and to melt the steel.
They skimmed the slag off the top
and when it was ready, they poured
the molten mass into ingot molds.
There was nothing they could do for the foreman,
they said. Production had to keep going.
 
Heavy looks into the eyes of his listeners and says:
Somewhere there’s a skyscraper in downtown LA
with steel beams made from the ingot
with the foreman’s body in it.
Somewhere there’s a bridge or underground pipe
with the man’s remains chemically bound
within the molecular structure.
 
Heavy tells a story. . .
 
and the men lay down their tools,
and coffee is poured into heavy ceramic cups,
the shanty stills beneath the rumbling,
and even foremen stop by
to pay a listen
when Heavy tells a story.

As sharp as a sword-cut    the light struck    a half-reclining cloud

Joy     joy     joy although not joy    a bad thing

I don’t want to talk     of infinitesimal distinctions
between man and man     see no difference     between men and maidens

chapter xiv 
After a bad night I lock myself in my room and read
I had only imagination
I remember how on our wedding day    he said
I shall never let trouble or nervousness concern you    you can trust me
I must not forgive    I cannot    
I know the real truth now
My imagination tinges everything with ill adventure
I suppose a cry clears the air    as other rain does
 
• 
I have a good memory for details
it is not always so with young ladies    or so it had been said to me
I cannot comprehend this husband
Women all their lives are interrupted    considered hysterical
summoned to make children for the strong and manly
and for his sake must smile and not speak
Now this man I began to think a weak fool
I had trusted him    my husband
even half believed his words when he said
I would have an ordinary life    without dread
 
• 
Let me tell you from experience of men
his brain and heart are terrible things
This man    impotent in the dark
He succeeded in getting me to doubt
everything took a hue of unreality
I did not trust even my own senses
You don’t know what it is to doubt everything    even yourself
I am a wife he fashioned by his own hand
to be sweet and earnest and so kind
 
• 
An idea struck me
Following great loss     people see things that others cannot
Men want to explain explain explain
see themselves new    pretend to be young
Ladies’ bodies are deemed unholy
by the very men who burn them
Generations of men believe that women
walk amongst them without knowledge
My thesis is this
I want to believe    to believe    
to believe in
a universe    willing
to understand
 
chapter xxi 
A detail in a pool of blood
the body gathered in an awkward kink
I dress myself  in easy anything
 
• 
I softened into a swollen confusion
only slightly solid    I was shining
He beckoned
His hands    a dark mass like a thousand rats
A cloud closed over my eyes
I moistened myself with brandy
I held tight to life
I became like water
 
• 
Kneeling on the edge of the bed    his face was turned
his left hand    held both arms    his right gripped
my neck    blood    a thin stream of it    his nostrils quivered
 
• 
I lay in disarray
my eyes    and from them came    an endless moment
Cold moonshine dazed me    I began to pull on clothes
I drew back    unclean
Shame folded me like steel    tried to twist me in obedience
I could not feel the rise of reddening dawn
Silence    the sound of  what happened
 
• 
I want you to know all this
understand    how much I need to show you
It was he who caused me to disappear
My husband    my husband and other men
hunt me and command    my flesh my blood my brain
This is my pollution story
 
• 
The eastern sky became clear
             as the awful narrative deepened
                          in the morning light
                                       when the first red streak shot up my flesh

La Flaca. Señora Negra. La Huesuda.¡Aguas!An animalis prowlingthis station. It shimmies with hunger.It shimmerswith thirst.To keep it away,
I hurl my memories at it. Your laughter is nowsnaggedon its fangs.Your painnow breathes inside its lungs. Tastethe feeling.Siempre Coca-Cola.America’s

In the desert, the moonshivers. Tonight, to stay awake, I’ll cut my feet
with glass.Outside Oaxaca, in a clinic, my mother said,
“I hate your Indian face.”In the dream I’m running. My limbs skeletal
and scabbed.After my mother’s death, I found, in a box,
her wedding dress.As I lifted the lid, a stench corkscrewed
into my nostrils:the dress had curdled like milk. During the day
I gather tinder.Paper. Shed snakeskin. When the last light
above the mountainsknots into stars, I crouch under mesquite,make a fire.Sometimes the moon stops shivering. Sometimes
I tally what I owe.In the dream I’m running through a hallway.
The floor uneven.The walls green. Last month, as my son blew out
the candleson his cake, I noticed, for the first time,
the hideous shapeof his nose. Tonight I’ll pinch my thighs to stay
awake. My mother,in the clinic, said, “The rain has a fever, it
needs plentyof rest, it needs to drink plenty of water.” The doctor
scribbled in a filethen asked for more money. If my mother
could see me now!My feet bloody. My face darker than ever.
Tonight, to stay awake,I’ll sit close to the fire. In the dream I stumble,
but I never let goof my right breast: an urn heavy with my own
ashes, an urnI’m lugging God-knows-where.

                ","

What you need will come to you at the right time says the tarot card I overturned at my friend Nathalie’s house one evening. I was wondering if she said something worth hearing, What? I’m looking at her face, trying to read it, not a clue what she said but I’ll just say yeah and hope. Me, Tabitha, and her aunt are waffling in Waffle House by the Mississippi River. Tabitha’s aunt is all mumble. She either said Do you want a pancake? or You look melancholic. The less I hear the bigger the swamp, so I smile and nod while my head becomes a faint foghorn, a lost river. Why wasn’t I asking her to microphone? When you tell someone you read lips you become a mysterious captain. You watch their brains navigate channels with BSL interpreters in the  corner of night TV. Sometimes it’s hard to get back the smooth sailing and you go down with the whole conversation. I’m a haze of broken jars, a purple bucket and only I know there’s a hole in it. On Twitter @justnoxy tweets I can’t watch TV / movies / without subtitles. It’s just too hard to follow. I’m just sitting there pretending and it’s just not worth it. I tweet back you not being able to follow is not your failure. It’s weird, giving the advice you need to someone else, weird as thinking my American friend said I move through London like a Hotep when she actually said I’m used to London life with no sales tax. Deanna (my friend who owns crystals and mentions the existence of multiple moons) says I should write about my mishearings, she thinks it’ll make a good book for her bathroom. I am still afraid I have grown up missing too much information. I think about that episode of The Twilight Zone where an old man walks around the city bar selling bric-a-brac from his suitcase, knowing what people need — scissors, a leaky pen, a bus ticket, combs. In the scene, music is playing loud, meaning if I were in that bar I would miss the mysticism while the old man’s miracles make the barman say WOAH, this guy is from another planet!

The Sangre de Cristo Mountains mottled as if with oil stains. Configurations of cloud-shadows.
Easy gait of hours: a way through — or into — the dry winds.Our church is the mountains, says the guide to the tour group, all of whom have been instructed to keep their cameras inside their bags.  A group crowding the aisles of San Geronimo Chapel.
On the dirt path between adobe structures, bareheaded. Stretching, palms out, as steam from the boiling pot does.
To move along the earth without keeping a ledger.
The horsefly not so incongruous with the sagebrush. Still, reflexive swatting.We’re good citizens, we serve in the Army, though we’re regarded as second  class by the US government.
Framed badges and news stories in the house of the retired sheriff. Men in his family who have been policemen, firemen, soldiers. His wife pinching the ears of bear sculptures formed from mica clay.
Thick paste of red soil and the piñon that pierces through it.
To carry on from day to day without exercising the sloppy hand of  manipulation.
Four dollars for a plate of fry bread in cinnamon butter. The boy at the counter restless, wanting to get back to the electronic dance  music on pause on his iPhone.
Reading a history backward, the deep strata.
Settling on this life as a parasite on its host.That man next door who you bought from? He sells jewelry made by an Anglo woman. His wife.
The stray dog asleep on her side, dreams ripped from her open jaw.
Money touched from hand to hand.
Whole lifetimes spent trying to make sense of an appetite.

about me dying.
Since yesterday he has not been
crying as much as screaming
like it is terrifying

It is terrifying to wake up
and terrifying to sleep
and his feet going blue in the cold
spring air
in which he is growing.
His mother is growing him
with the milk she makes all day,
spilling out in blue.
The song I am singing to him
puts him to sleep,
will put me to sleep.

screaming from far off,
though you don’t know
if it’s hurting or hungry or nothing at all.

The Ware Collection of Blaschka Glass Models of Plants,  Harvard Museum of Natural History



The ovaries, when splayed, resemblesliced tomatoes. Or rose windows,
each geometry precise enoughto praise. I want to press my tongue
against the bloodroot petal, to runits stamen along my slick shelf of
teeth like a man might with a wheat stalk.Four times so far other tourists
have taken me for a galleryattendant. In the glass, a slow-
sidling crimson spreads over my ownskewed reflection: a hesitant
teen in a Harvard hoodie, the fifth,leans in to ask, Excuse me, sir?Are they really glass? — a testamentto how my binder encases
my breasts, my faith in the plum yew’s fruit-shorn frenzy. Dense clusters teeming
with their separate blossoms, anyunknowing eye might think they were
living. But I know the lilac’s tell:two blemishes, bulbous where some
hot glass mis-dripped, then caught foreverin the filament. Sometimes, I think
I’ll wake to find they’ve finallytrickled off me in the night, pooled
molten down the bed and gatheredback again. I might thrash off both breasts
in a sleepless fit, or could unfurlmy clit like a pollen basket passed
from a honeybee’s hind legsto the hive. It makes its secret
seen. I can only answer yes. Yes,They’re real. I mean, they’re really glass.
You could snap a stem between fingerswith such a slight force, one stark blink — 
the flies flitting the gallery would fearthe weight of their own landing,
thick wings rapt still. When the public,in their distressed astonishment,
demanded to know how the Blaschkastransported the models without
a fracture in even one pistil,Leopold Blaschka revealed his own
elaborate process: pack eachflower tightly in its cardboard
cradle, then strap them down with strong wireto restrict movement, and set each, at last,
in a wooden box wrapped with burlap.They drove them straight from Manhattan
in two hearses. The drivers, of course,wore black suits. Onlookers parted
to allow their small procession past.I like it here, with everyone
focused on the flowers. Hunched, kneeling,as if suspicious, still doubting,
the teen eyes two tiny zinnias,then moves on to another case.
I’ve seen many leave unsatisfied.They can’t bear to be partitioned — 
how can I blame them? Someone made thesewith their body. They let their breath
unspool to form each impossiblebud, crafted every flower’s fold,
then waited on the heat to break tohold just one, wearing special gloves.
Wouldn’t anyone wish for just one lieamong a garden this precise?
One daisy swapped out in secret, switchedwith a common courtyard flower,
now waiting for someone to noticeits wilt while its counterparts keep
all their glisten. It does seem to metrue punishment: never to change.
Unflinching forever. Sometimes, nearclosing, when the hall becomes quiet,
I really do believe they’re real.

There I was, all spread out for the taking,
bloomed wings waiting for winter
sleet. It was a long season of drinking whole
creeks and nothing else. We churned desert
into desert. What I’m saying is, neither the desert
rat nor damselfly can bear the nosebleeds: shoal-
laced face bearing down just in time to overwinter.
There I was, all spread out for the taking.
In truth, nobody wants water this thin.
One swallow, and we’re off to dig for more within
a hollow womb. This morning we sip water,
discussing the trauma in our blood: saltwater — 
there it rests, in droplets, on my breast skin,
“Oh,” I say. “My tears,” rubbing them deep within.xi
At church I sat salvaged: I said to send me
away wearing nothing but satin and lace.
We both felt secondhand. It was knee-
length, and it wore me cheap. I couldn’t embrace
the old woman who once wore it, couldn’t see
my wrists even. And my neck, it was braced
up all in lace. The woman next to me says,
“How beautiful.” I say, “This beautiful,” then split
a hair down the middle. I lied, “I made it myself,”
then stood up to fade through painstaking
humiliation. As a child, a girl, I saw through myself
to age 45. It was then when I first noticed the aching
of my hands, how they were soon to set themselves
away — they came and went, as if they were lace for the breaking.xiii
I was reciting Alfred, Lord Tennyson on my back,
in a canoe, floating the holiest way I knew — 
so close to ghost, and went pale for a moment
before finding myself wandering among high pines.
I didn’t expect to emerge in white already
with my heart in his hand, just as normal
as a shell rests on my chest. Didn’t expect
to hand it over so early on, at the boundary
of our properties in a dream: in the grasses

day: a decade staring back
in the rearview mirror
of the wrecked pickup truck: you
standing so tall you’re already
headless: until I turn around
the cornfield blurs into the torn
edges of an atlas: pull your hands
out from under me to anoint this god-
given country of yours: mottled bones
singing the anthem of a star-
spangled nation: this land
given enough time to list its own
possibilities: atrocities
like a blade of dusk resting
on my throat, I bruise: by standing
I practice the sacred: & kneel
how the body was built
toward the bottomless insides
of ghosts: the small of my back
the sacrum: they say, the five
disciples with pocked faces
unlike your self-inflicted gunshot
but a single entryway: an emptiness
full of faith: rise to me as only you
would after god has left
you with these entrance wounds
with no way out: the purpling field
that goes on & on: recognizable
as a heartbeat: a century-
long orbit around a cage
of stained glass: broken, you
gather me in your image
of failed flesh: piecing mirror
after mirror back together through
the night until nobody forgets: one
hundred years of this landscape behind

chirping desert and distant night, I gazed upon a slow-moving
dark, encasing a convex cerulean cavity
each night, I stood beneath the sky for hours mesmerized
at the perplex reformatory, twinkling lights of broken
glass fragments spreading against a glistening sunset
a faceless man behind a lost reflection of glass
at a drive-up window informs me,too bad, you know nothing of your own past
how far will I walk against the night?
conforming to a captivity I had never realized
some years later, under the kitchen table, they all huddle,
as the rampage continues toward the back of the house,
a clash of debris from the other room recoils
and broken sounds escape the barricade of doors

all they remember is me sitting at the edge of my bed,
with the war still in my hands

there is a story we tell. a story about suffering. not because we are only suffering, but because that is the story we have been taught to tell. take a beetle for instance. it talks of nothing other than the leaf it chews. the angularity of it. the soft brush underneath. there are many beetles. far more than there are humans. somehow our voices always drown them out. take crows for instance. they have been known to fish. not with their beaks but with fiberglass poles left idle by drunken fishermen. or maybe they are just sleeping. either way the crow speaks only of fish. the cold flesh. the fragile meat. in the story i tell myself there are often buffalo. not because they are prolific, but because they occupy the expanse of my memory, its continent. the buffalo are only a metaphor. snow is also a metaphor. bodies blanketed in white. freezing. we are all rigid with it. the story. tell something different. something about the rain. the sound of it. like walking skyward. away from one’s origins. what has been culled from one atmosphere falling gently into another.

We didn’t know my mother was driving
back to her childhood, with a ring
of keys, a compass, and a tiger
panting in the back seat. Soon enough
the tiger was behind the wheel, circling.
And each circle spun further and
further away from us. When she calls,
the tiger has parked the yellow-striped taxi
on the highway’s rough shoulder. It’s time,
she says, for this dream to be over. Time
to go home, sleep in her own bed.
If the compass ever worked, she’s forgotten
how to read it, and the ring for the keys
is broken, the keys melted down
for their metal. If I would just call someone
and tell him where she is. She has money —
she can pay someone to drive her home.
If only a road sign were in sight, but no, there’s
only scattered chert and farmland
and a man across the road who is not my father.

yellow eyes are slightly open. Behind the wheel
the tiger snacks on the summer of 1970 and
the entire works of Iris Murdoch.
Caught in his teeth are recipes for chocolate mousse
and coq au vin, my brother’s first arrest, the one-

Late fall the white fur grew up your spine
thick as the tail of a marten. You built up the fire,
wrapped your legs with skins, but how that
chill wind broke through sill and jamb.
We stuffed paper in every crevice — an uncle’s will,
the writ that changed your name, a certificate
of Degree of Indian Blood and one that said O positive. Still
we shivered, your eyes yellow in the lantern’s light.
Always, they were out there, in a field of boulders
the size of bears hunched over. O, you were silky
with fur, with a sharp smell I could not get enough of.
I fell into a dream of milk and skin,
on the bed of pelts in the winter cabin. When I woke
they had taken you or you had gone with them.
And didn’t I, so green with sleep, track you
the three days until new snow fell?2
I packed flint and tinder and a compass
whose face shines in the lowest light.
I learned a song to map the way
and one to call you back.
I crouched over every footprint,
sniffing.And herewas a broken branch and here
something like hair caught by a bramble.
I followed and followed — all the yellow hours,
until I came to untouched earthand waited
in the clearing for the snow to come downwhite
as the winter blanket you long had wanted.3
In the spring when you
come down hungry from
that other mountain
the space between one rib
and the next deep enough
to lay my finger — 
how much of you will
remain or linger — 
bone or mouth or memory
of the first sadness of humans?
Will you dig from the crevices
the paper where they
wrote you down as this
instead of that? Or startle
at the clatter of plates?
The creak of the wooden bed?
Will your skin shake off
its fur, your claws remember
they were fingers? And the hands,
meaty as paws, soften into
what I once could stroke or suckle?

asters and sparrows to be exact,
that unrelenting knot in
the choral fire. It’s good exercise, to get out
on stage, to stand in the silvered chamber
and deny emptiness, when the pocket falls so deep
one could mark anything out over the top.

its likeness, still Helen as phantom
not the truth of the state of her body
but being awash in a sound uprooted.
The desk is still a symbol I pile things on,
pin down elegies, illegible dates, introductions scrawled
on slender backs of envelopes, receipts, small machine-like
cloud chambers, talon disconnected.
Sunlight burns my feet putting away
the wet mop, where I am stopped
from almost killing myself. All that wobbling of the lensnonsense, I will cling to the truth of the soundtrack

I am not murdered, and I am not missing, but parts of me have been disappeared.
— Leanne Simpson



They too know all too well that some cracks were built just for us to fall through.  We live in a world that tries to steal spirits each day; they steal ours by taking us away.
From Industrial Schools to forced assimilation, genocide means removal  of those who birth nations — our living threatens. Colonization has been choking
us for generations. I tell my girls they are vessels of spirit, air to lungs expanding; this world cannot breathe without us. There are days  I wish
I didn’t have to teach these lessons, but as an Indigenous womxn  silence is deadening. There is danger in being seen, our bodies are targets
marked for violence. We carry the Earth’s me too inside us,  a howling wind, our mothers & their mothers swallowed these bullets long ago.
The voices ricochet I wish I were invisible I wish I were invisible  I wish echoes  in my eardrums — we know what it’s like to live in fear. Colonialism’s bullet sits cocked,
waiting behind a finger on trigger. We breathe and speak and sing  for survival. We carve out in lines; we write — I know joy I know pain I know loveI know love I know — lessons we’ve carried throughout time. Should I go missing: don’t stop searching; drag every river until it turns red and the waters of our names
stretch a flood so wide it catches everything. And we find each other whole and sacred, alive and breathing and breathing and breathing.

For Julien Poirier



Eke out a few more bars for the jewels behind doors. Lutes and harps lay up to bolster language out from underneath. More absentmindedly walking the room, swishing about beyond argument or caging names. Calling out over the whole wet season, commercial speculations (cycles). I love that edge the wall makes — casino game-board green — my love comes bursting out the center of the glass (foiled) I abandon my trap in fragments. The grand terrace band (it’s waning) finale of synchronized dives, straight to my deepest forest overnight, this unfinished, uproarious music for vacuum.

I don’t understand this kindergarten
assignment: “Draw Your Clan.”
The three letters live in abstraction.
A friend suggests mine looks like his, minus
legs, and that day I believe my clan is
a species of amputee Snipes, birds
forced to fly the skies forever, and I
wonder if we are meant to symbolize
endurance or something beyond
my five-year-old comprehension.2
My mother explains we are not legless
birds and if she had a more worldly
vocabulary she would have suggested
we were ambiguous, not quite a fish,
more than a water snake, but she says
we are among the few. The last Tuscarora Eel
died out a generation ago, so we are left
Onondaga Eels among the Tuscarora,
voiceless as well as legless.3
I find an encyclopedia photo,
see jagged rows of razor teeth
in a mouth perpetually grinning
and when I show it to her, she says
clans are a system to keep track
of families, so we don’t inadvertently
marry our relatives, and that we have no
more affinity with eels than anyone else
on the reservation has with their animals.4
“If I threw you in the dike,” she says
“you’d drown as fast as anyone else,” done
with this lesson. I remember older cousins,
swimming between my legs, and suddenly I am rising,
their hands grabbing my knees as my balls collide
with the backs of their necks, and they break
the surface, toss me into deeper water, probably
watching to make sure I surface, after they’ve had
some amusement at my struggle.5
In wet darkness, I imagine opening
my eyes and mouth, taking water in,
filling my lungs, discovering gills
like Aquaman or Namor, the Sub-mariner.
Knowing I had better odds of dying, face down,
no voice to call out for help, I am
never quite brave enough to try it, not daring
enough, even, to open my eyes when my face breaks
the stillness of river water contained.6
But I flip on my back, ears below the surface, listen
to mysteries, breathe shallowly at that level, and float,
wondering what it would be like to glide the depths
on fins, knowing if I were there, I would desire
legs and lungs, and then I fill my chest to capacity,
and dive, loving and begrudging the ache I find there,
the throbbing of my chest begging for release,
and I swim back up, eyes still closed, wondering how
long it will take to find the surface again.

I stood in a longhouse
with a woman who may or may not
be Mohawk. Some shift their opinions
about her like meteorologists, as if
her blood were a storm system tracked
in its comings and goings. But the father
of her two sons was, without question, Seneca.
We knew that, in Haudenosaunee country, a father
is to some degree irrelevant, that her own
shifting identity would impact her sons’ lives
like a gene vulnerable to betrayal, causing
certain, terminal conditions. She waited
on an elder she called Steam (warning I was not
to call the elder woman by that name). Steam
(not Steam) would observe the boys, understand
their natures, give them their Creator names defining
their lives during the next ceremony. I confessed
my namelessness, confessed my longhouse- and fluency-
deficient community, and confessed that my clan
mother, three hours away, did not know me well
enough to give me a name, confessed my community followed
a more casual ceremony. You find your name after a social misstep,
a dubious facial feature, a birth defect. Names offer
the name-givers comfort, that your challenge is harder
than theirs, no matter the truth.
Our names are a convoluted toughening of our skins. My name
is not like Steam (no one is forbidden to use it). No one
calls me Batman because of my status, my utility
belt, my impressive batpole, my agility, my muscles,
my profile in spandex, my virtues, but because I wore
the cape to an older age than I should have, and could
continue to wear it now, as that shit is not going away
any time soon. Even kids who only know Christian Bale
or Michael Keaton, lurking in latex and leather hood,
still think Batman is my name.
And this is why I have no memory for when or how you became
the Bumblebee, what it means, beyond the literal.
You soar in gardens, spend days ensuring growth,
and if metaphors are at work here, this one seems true
enough to keep you in amber wings, fuzzy yellow rings,
black lacquer torso, and sensitive antennae.
What metaphor suits the night I left on the Amtrak
for Chicago, past 1:00 a.m., while you stood
on the platform, watching those cars pull out,
the night I wanted to leap from the train, stay?
I cannot invent new names for the ways we slow,
struggle, attempt to maintain the illusion of futures
without measure, defy actuary numbers and because I have
gone closer to the light than you have, the story is
easier to craft and finesse than it should be.
Pollination trails are smaller than those I’m forced
to fly in, and lying in Little Rock, Santa Fe, Manhattan,
Minneapolis, Seattle, hotel rooms, the ellipse of your name
trail winds me home, waiting, dusted in pollen and history.

 act 1, scene 1: do you know what it means for our survival?  
Fog spun into silk
              on the knee of the comptroller,
              propelled toward the crest of Ontario,
              the old, faded star, steambreath onto the windshield.
To orient in the finest sense
              of cackles, mute chrysanthemums,
              funneling inordinate nakedness,
              absorbed, absorbed, immediately absorbed.
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh,
we stay
limber,
each line
choreographed
from a tremendous mouthful
of swamp, skunk cabbage
              brining at the jowls,
              acquiesced to pestilence,
              and exaggerated diffidence.
Do you know what it is to clamp your shell
              an extra foot into the silt riverbank,
              kissing the soles of passersby,
              silky grains churning the earth over?
Makeshift ceremonial dances,
              fine textiles culled from thrift store bins
              display brightly-colored throats who feed
              stacks of cash killed on recycled names.
There is a golden tapestry
              on the berry-stained
              bottom of Wealth Woman’s
              basket of abalone.
              Beneath it are the exhausted
              faces of her babies
              grown old in the length
              of the inhale, and a facsimile
              remains from all the cycles
              spilled over, since nature
              cannot acid wash, since
              frizz canvassing the ozone
              always carries over.
Geometry for days, countless days,
              spin-cycled through a craftsman’s
              circumpolar hands. There’s always
              another grotto or chamber
              where things dwell, they say.
              Wandering skitterers we are,
              the Northern Lights vacuum pried-open skulls.
                            We cover ourselves with hides and entrails,
                            overripe elderberries, looking to steal a moment
                            of letup from the glare. The limbs of the Old Ones
                            shunt aside bare toes, stripped solid
                            and indifferent as a bear’s den
                            or an ant’s apartment.
Don’t be so much in charge, the frogs say,
              of coalescing wolverine trails
              huddled in 60-million-year pellet tracks
              when the wetlands dried out.
The way soaked, green corpuscles
              rasp each other’s mouths and hands
              braiding the woof of God’s mind,
              that’s how it is, says
              the giant rat’s captive wife.
Even if you can only faintly hear
              the eighth narrative told in the corner
              of the babbling wooden-slat house,
              that is enough leftover hooligan grease
              for the gods with killer whale ganglia.
Knuckles rasp proscenium floorboards,
              splattering herring peck at scops owl’s waist,
              spruce branch
              lowered,
              scrapes conglomerate bedrock.Mother-in-law’s atonic hands lunge for stewed milt.
One can conclude it’s a virus
              to plant burdensome layers
              of topographic crust on self-renewing
              limbs, like there was more to it
              than rustling fingers at the end of the line.
All components must be in order,
              or it’s an ulcer here, a bladder infection
              there, a baked-out parking lot,
              fizzing in trampled-over, chastened hairlines.
Hold, hold, hold, hold in your palms
              the Steller’s jay that beats its wings
              on glaciers lying high and straight
              over rivers slicing into cool nettles.
Sea lions suck up a quick breath, dive
              and waft on the outskirts of ballerinas
              who gyrate in like-mind
              to classics bubbling up from Sedna’s citadels.
I’m here to show you what you can do
              with this sandbar dialect,
              says the humpback whale
              and the goatsbeard moss, and the ore
              of iron oxide in the shoreline cliff.
You must trust, she says,
                            your swimming blood, joints
                            lumbering in shadows, the dolphin
                            clicking out to you, far above ground.
                            And we should feed just as much as eat,
                            says the heart your body formed around.

To be a bride of my own lamentation
I wear a dress not of time’s poisoned quills
but feathers of discontent — kingfishers
ghosting in cornstalks, my field of frozen flutes.
The edge of descent, digression’s highway
brings a particulate ash to my mouth,
starry metals of the meadow’s cold snap,
ravens in the sycamore scorched to black.
I follow their echo’s loop and chase.
I master the map of never, raft
its fragments, mouth the brightness of human’s
leftover snow, details of fever-clouds
where the convent dissolves in violence.
I wear the canyon like a blank eye,
lay before the never-returning light
my silhouette, fossil of the drowned town’s scroll.•
Here, where your ghost is always departing
the ebb and flow of terrestrial tides,
I follow your echo’s loop and chase,
vortex streets of a cylindrical sound
infinite in its arrangements of light.
The evening veil, a partial reveal — 
how I appear to myself looking past
this fact of being underway. Each day
I stow my earthen materials
in preparation for the never-end.
In the snapshot of my dead friend, hanging
in the room where loved ones refuse return:
a gradual reduction of color.
Running out of time, neck-deep in water,
we knew no one was coming to help us
in the same way one denies language
to come from a picture. I imagine
love a revelation, not of mind — 
the blue gauze of planetary motion — 
a tone-on-tone painting of a body
floating on the sea’s shifting horizons.
It is a question of legibility.
When I became tired of depicting
poetry, I became aware of
another kind of plane, the kind
good for dwellings and their narrative escape.
Here children sit up all night by the flames — 
the orphan boy from blood-stained pottery
who singed his head and burned out both his eyes.
That was your life, a prefix for fire.
Spider will weave a ladder to your heart,
it is said, even though you are sleeping,
intoxicated by abandonment,
a bitter wind reminiscent of a wave.•
In the last days of my marriage to god,
I wandered his spiraled library
to read in the dark blank imprints of trees.
Relentless navigation through the stacks
of shell-tempered mortuary offerings,
sandstone saws recovered from the caves.
I lingered on the stairs of the convent
to write these things, to recollect myself.
Around midnight the mountains returned.
The clouds dispersed into semicolons
and I with them, into a new language,
its boat temporary, invisible.
I knew I would be traveling like this
for centuries. This was my first attempt
at vanishing. I would return before
anyone noticed poems to be found
in the forest, not the mind.
There’s a canyon between this version of me
and the shadow in the corner that is mine.
I wear this canyon like a blank eye.
